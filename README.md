The idea is to fetch info from:
http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/apps/projects/index.cfm?menu=secondary

For each of the projects listed on this webpage, fetch:
* title
* description
* each of the "Project ID card" fields
* Participating partners (number of partners and number of partner countries)

Show results somehow in a CSV

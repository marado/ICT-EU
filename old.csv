Decision makers in charge of educational, training and employment policies and guidance practitioners will reach citizens that wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take benefit from traditional guidance. In a long term such a service could reduce management costs and procedures. The eGOS prototype will be jointly used with already existing traditional educational and vocational guidance services. Users who won&rsquo;t use distance guidance activities will receive help and advice in a traditional way as always. **** Contact information **** GRASSO Paolo via Montefalco 55 52100 Arezzo ITALY Tel. +39 0575 40281 Fax. +39 0575 402850";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.1.3 - Innovative solutions for inclusive and efficient eGovernment";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" 224971";" From 01/11/2008 to 31/10/2011";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"21";"5"
"project-224974";"PEPPOL: Pan European Public Procurement OnLine (PEPPOL)";"**** eProcurement - Opening doors to cross-border business **** Many EU countries use electronic procurement (eProcurement) to make bidding for public sector contracts simpler and more efficient. However, these national solutions have limited communication across borders. PEPPOL will make electronic communication between companies and government bodies possible for all procurement processes in the EU. It will connect existing national systems, crucial for allowing businesses to bid for public sector contracts anywhere in the EU; an important step towards achieving the Single European Market.  eProcurement systems are already functioning in several Member States. However, many public administrations lag behind industry in electronic data exchange with their suppliers. The lack of common standards is a major obstacle for companies - especially small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) - participating in public procurement. PEPPOL will build on current eProcurement activities at national level to allow companies in the EU to communicate electronically with government institutions in other countries for procurement processes.  The pilot project will facilitate the electronic cross border exchange of orders, invoices, and catalogues. It also includes the reuse of company information required for bidding. The mutual recognition of electronic signatures will also be addressed. A core team of EU Member States are involved in this project in order to ensure that the development of new technologies in different countries does not create new barriers to the Single Market.  Both governments and their suppliers will benefit from more efficient, harmonized electronic procurement and invoicing processes.  It is anticipated that the use of eProcurement will save billions of Euros not only by reducing administrative burden but also by increasing competition and transparency. Taxpayers will ultimately benefit from the increased efficiency of the procurement processes and the savings achieved through better competition.   **** Contact information **** HODDEVIK AndrÃ© GREV WEDELS PLASS 9 0151 OSLO NORWAY Tel. +47 913 97 587 Fax. +47 22 45 10 01";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.1.1 - Enabling EU-wide public eProcurement";" Euro 30.80m";" Euro 15.40m";" 224974";" From 01/05/2008 to 30/04/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PA Pilot Type A ";"18";"12"
"project-224976";"DEN4DEK: Digital Ecosystems Network of regions for DissEmination and Knowledge deployment";"Digital Ecosystems are emerging as a novel approach for the catalysis of sustainable regional development driven by SMEs. The aim of the DEN4DEK thematic network is to share experience and disseminate all the necessary knowledge that allow regions to plan an effective deployment of the Digital Ecosystems (DE) at all levels (economic, social, technical and political) in order to produce real impacts in the economic activities of European regions through the improvement of SMEs business environments. The main claim that DEN4DEK makes is that in order to ensure the wider uptake and best use of ICT in businesses through the digital ecosystems (DE) approach it is necessary that the regions that have already a thorough knowledge and experience in the deployment of the DE work closely with the regions that are starting to integrate this concept into their innovation strategies. Our strategy is based on various techniques of knowledge sharing. Because the process of knowledge sharing must be sustainable and scalable, the regions of Aragon and the West Midlands, the only two regional DBE pilots with previous experience of local deployment in Europe (thanks to their direct participation in the EU 6th FP DBE integrated project), are leading the strategy. Along the knowledge-sharing strategy, partners are supported by regions which have already introduced the DE approach at the local level. It follows that DEN4DEK is the first step in a self-reinforcing community building process that will culminate at the end of the project with a community of knowledge, inclusive of all regional stakeholders, which will be able to build regional partnerships and business ecosystems fostering regional innovation. The project will integrate the available research outputs from the DBE Integrated Project, and will adapt and clarify the potential knowledge gaps with the rest of the regions and users.

"project-224985";"CLEAR: Clinical Leading Environment for the Assessment and validation of Rehabilitation Protocols for home care";"**** an eHealth initiative to design, develop and implement Clinical Rehab Protocols for Home Care for the Management of Chronic Diseases **** The CLEAR project proposes the implementation of e-rehabilitation services in 4 countries , with the ambition to scale it up after project completion and shown feasibility, to a European platform, likely to contribute substantially to the harmonization of e-health services in EU. The rationale behind the project is the HABILIS EUROPE concept, which aims at the establishment of a network of companies under a legal corporate entity, providing an expandable set of rehab- services across the whole EU, with significant potential to enhance the penetration of e-health services and optimization of healthcare resources. The CLEAR project, based on technological mature applications developed mainly within the H-CAD (IST -V Framework) and e-Ten Hellodoc projects, will provide the platform for the development of âhome treatment protocolsâ. These will be highly customizable by the healthcare professionals, who will be continuously involved in the system design and testing. The project plans to carry out 4 pilot tests in 4 countries (IT, ES, NL and PL) on home protocols and therapies developed on 4 types of pathologies usually affecting the elderly: neurological, orthopaedic, pneumonial disorders and chronic pain. The evaluation will be focused on the technical, organisational and legal feasibility of the service. Special attention will be paid to a systematic improvement and upgrade of the system based on the feedback of the users (both clinicians and patients). In its pilot phase, the project envisages to treat at least 1000 citizens. During the implementation substantial efforts will be made to refine the details of the financial plan, being the basis for the full deployment of the HABILIS network and to integrate new partnerships with health care institutions, technology providers, standardization bodies and associations of health care providers and patients. **** Contact information **** VARTULI Maria Teresa Via Nuova Panoramica 340 98168 MESSINA IT Tel. +39 090 357028 Fax. +39 090 356913";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" Objective 2.2 - ICT for ageing well";" Euro 5.62m";" Euro 2.74m";" 224985";" From 01/09/2008 to 31/08/2011";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"13";"4"

Collaborative, Interactive initiative for the successful deployment of eHealth in EU **** [Logo] Copyright: CALLIOPE The CALLIOPE Network is part of the Open eHealth Initiative, which is driven by Member States health administrations. It has been initiated by 17 health authorities and 10 organisations representing networks of physicians, community pharmacists, patients, industry and health insurers. It represents a targeted effort aiming to establish an appropriately governed, composed and structured open forum, with the focal goal to support Member States to implement interoperable eHealth solutions, in close collaboration with the key stakeholders, including users, industry and payers. CALLIOPE will therefore operate in synergy with cross border eHealth initiatives in Europe, in terms of supporting exchanges within a much broader community and will also be one of the major mechanisms for dissemination and propagation of EU level activities in this area. The Network has the ambition to contribute to standardisation activities through close liaison with relevant standardisation bodies, as well as to provide input to CIP PSP, towards better focusing of future programme funded activities in cross border eHealth. Initially, the network governance and the knowledge infrastructures will be developed and the CALLIOPE Network will be set to operation. As part of its work program, CALLIOPE will then serve a first set of operational objectives i.e., elaboration of a common Interoperability Road map; review and advancement of the EU Interoperability Recommendation and; facilitation of pre- standardisation processes through liaison with SDOs. It will furthermore offer a portfolio of targeted support services to be provided on request and by mobilising, to the extent possible, external resources, thus setting the network on track to self sustainability. This set of activities and related deliverables will also put to testing the network processes and the results will comprise part of the independent evaluation at the end of the project. **** Contact information **** PRENTZA Andriana Iroon Polytechniou Str 9 15773 Athens GREECE Tel. +302107722429 Fax. +302107722431";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.3.2 - Experience sharing and consensus building in eHealth";" Euro 0.50m";" Euro 0.50m";" 224986";" From 01/06/2008 to 01/12/2010";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme CIP-ICT-PSP-TN CIP-Thematic Network ";"26";"14"
"project-224988";"T-SENIORITY: T-SENIORITY: EXPANDING THE BENEFITS OF INFORMATION SOCIETY TO OLDER PEOPLE THROUGH DIGITAL TV CHANNELS";"**** General Public and Personalised e-Care Services via a new Provision Model using Digital-TV **** T-SENIORITY objective is to significantly improve quality of life and ensure efficient health and social care for the ageing population by specifying and demonstrating innovative ICT enabled products and services. The proposal is based in the integration of digital services addressed to elders and info- marginated audiences that will be accessed by TV channels and where the important segment of people already acquainted with the TV remote control can be included in the digital society and benefit from it. T-SENIORITY main target is a âuser-centricâ integration of services throughout TV, especially assistance programs (including trans-borders services) for disadvantaged social groups, focusing mainly in older people and âearly stages of getting olderâ people, to cover a diverse range of care needs in a wide range of service modalities (home care, tele-assistance, mobile telecom services, tele-alarms, nursing servicesâ¦.). It is a new service provision model that will use digital TV as the most widely available and preferred channel for info- marginated sectors, helping to reach difficult-to-reach audiences, such as âdisabled people getting olderâ, who may have less access to other forms of digital technology, improving current situation and affording the demands of a growing elderly population. T-SENIORITY Digital inclusion is, therefore, social inclusion with an ICT TV stream. It emphasises the digital inclusion through TV in Prevention and Early Action side of the Social Care, in order to avoid undesirable situations or to correct them at the shortest time. According to this, T-SENIORITY is a set of integrated care e-Service throughout TV oriented towards the Elders (and/or dependent people), and their Informal Carers. Informal Carers play an important part in the lives of many elderly people. T- SENIORITY supports these carers as well as the sufferers themselves, because, in many cases they are also info-marginated.

"project-224991";"epSOS: Smart Open Services - Open eHealth Initiative for a European Large Scale Pilot of Patient Summary and Electronic Prescription";"SOS project becomes Smart Open Services for European Patients (epSOS) to better reflect the focus on patient needs. [epSOS] Copyright: epSOS Patient summaries and ePrescriptions Patient summaries and electronic prescriptions (ePrescriptions) are two key services that enable high quality medical care. Such health records provide health professionals with essential information on the medical and medication history of the patient. In many situations access to such information can save lives (for example in case of allergies to medications, chronic conditions, blood disorders). The epSOS project is a first step in addressing problems faced by doctors treating patients who seek health treatment when abroad. These problems include re-supplying essential medication that a patient has lost or forgotten, communicating medical situations to foreign-language doctors, diagnosing illness and prescribing proper medication with little knowledge of patient history. Several Member States have implemented these services in their national healthcare systems and several others are about to do so. However, many of them cannot currently communicate with each other. These services will only be widely used if they are trusted by both patients and healthcare professionals. Appropriate data protection, system security and performance criteria need to be included in any cross border application. Objective The objective of the epSOS project is to ensure that these national solutions can &ldquo;talk to each other&rdquo;. epSOS aims at enabling health professionals to electronically access the data of a patient from another country in their own language, using different technologies and systems. It will also make it possible for pharmacies to electronically process prescriptions from other Member States, so that patients travelling within the EU can obtain the essential medicine. The approach The project follows a bottom-up approach; it builds on existing technical solutions, and develops a set of specifications to ensure the interoperability of solutions, including security and identification systems and performance criteria. The project will examine the level of maturity and deployment of patient summaries and ePrescriptions in the participating countries, and explore legal questions and develop technical specifications covering all basic components for a secure use of personal health data. In a second phase, the project will define, test and validate these solutions in real-life situations. The approach will form the basis for a longer term, pan-European approach to building service solutions that will be able to work with each other. The project responds to the commitment of Member States and the European Commission to achieve full interoperability of eHealth services. It will benefit from guidance provided by the Commission on how to make electronic health record systems work together. **** Contact information **** LINDÃN FREDRIK Hornsgatan -20 118 82 Stockholm 20001001 Tel. +46 8 452 7334 Fax. +46 8 452 7050";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" Objective 3.1 - EU wide implementation of eHealth services to support continuity of care: patient¿s summary and ePrescription";" Euro 23.07m";" Euro 11.00m";" 224991";" From 01/07/2008 to 30/06/2011";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PA Pilot Type A ";"27";"13"
"project-224993";"STORK: Secure Identity Across Borders Linked";"**** eID - easier access to public services across the EU  **** Several barriers to free movement of workers still exist in the EU: for example, it is not easy to access public services while working or living in another country. The European Commission has launched a pilot project to remedy this situation with an EU-wide system for the recognition and authentication of electronic identity (eID via electronic cards or other means). It will enable businesses and citizens to securely use their national electronic identities and get help from public administrations in any Member State they live in or travel to. The pilot project launched by the Commission aims to achieve the pan-European recognition of electronic IDs. This will be done without imposing one single solution but allowing national systems to work together. The pilot project will test some of the services that are most useful to the many Europeans working and studying in EU countries other than their own. The participating countries will test a set of services using open standards. These include: - a common service architecture allowing citizens to use their national eIDs to access e-Government portals across borders, - a platform for safer online communication using eIDs for children, - a service facilitating students&rsquo; mobility across Europe, - use of eID for cross-border electronic delivery for citizens and businesses, - and for testing the electronic process of address change for EU citizens that move to other Member States. Technical solutions  The project will develop, test and validate common specifications for national eID systems to work together. These will be made freely available. All Member States, including those not participating in the project, will be consulted on the common specifications so that the project can have a wide impact. All industries that would like to develop services for eID in the future will have equal and free access to the common specifications. Reference materials, guidelines, manuals and educational materials will also be made available allowing the replication and implementation of solutions in other countries. A number of events, workshops and consultations will also be organised during the project. Security Security and privacy are serious concerns within the project.  All efforts will be made to ensure that mutual recognition of electronic identity makes identity theft extremely difficult. As authentication levels for a given application may differ across Member States, the project will develop &ldquo;circles of trust&rdquo; at European scale. Impact The project will result in the smooth cross-border operation of several key public services. The solution will be scalable to all EU Member States. It will be technology-transparent, robust, with measurable benefits, and will be implemented in such a way that it is sustainable beyond the life of the pilot. As a building block towards the realisation of an internal market without borders, this project will save time and money with safer transactions, less fraud, better control over personal data and simplified procedures. **** Contact information **** GARCIA Alicia ALBARRACIN 25 28037 MADRID SPAIN Tel. +34912148800 Fax. -";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.1.2 - Towards pan-European recognition of electronic IDs (eIDs)";" Euro 20.31m";" Euro 10.00m";" 224993";" From 01/06/2008 to 01/06/2011";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme CIP-ICT-PSP-P CIP-Pilot actions ";"29";"15"

Alarm and alerts are received and handled by a Contact Centre or by health and social professionals on duty, supported by a powerful DSS, which selects the most suitable action and possibly dispatch the appropriate resources (fire brigade, ambulance, GP on duty, nurse, social worker, etc.). The DREAMING solution will be piloted in Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The pilots are aimed at verifying the impact of the service on the quality of life of elderly people, their formal and informal caregivers and their relatives, on economic and clinical indicators, its financial sustainability and the satisfaction of users. This will help to refine the DREAMING business case in view of a large-scale deployment. DREAMING is based on state-of-the-art technologies which are available off the shelf. This allows a fast set-up of the pilot sites and enables trials long enough (30 months) to gather sufficient experimental data to strengthen the business case and plan the subsequent deployment phase. Thanks to DREAMING it will be possible extending the independent living span of elders while reducing the overall cost of assisting them. Savings so obtained will allow in turn to extend the DREAMING coverage and benefits to an increasing number of elders and to address the issue of the ageing population in a socially acceptable and financially sustainable manner. **** Contact information **** FLABOREA Michela P.zza San Giovanni 6 34122 Trieste 20000922 Tel. +39-040-764056 Fax. +39-040-660333";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.2.2 - ICT for ageing well";" Euro 5.66m";" Euro 2.77m";" 225023";" From 01/05/2008 to 30/06/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"12";"7"

The approach will focus on what has been done and what can be done in urban areas, places where the issue of energy efficiency is particularly crucial. The concept and reality of sustainable cities will be discussed and challenged through three working groups and the creation of a social network and best practices platform. These working groups will gather public and private stakeholders operating in the field of policy making, applied research and products conception around three topics: ICT for energy efficiency in buildings, ICT for energy efficiency in transportation and how ICT shall contribute to improved citizen behaviours regarding energy consumption. The scope of the project will therefore go from best practice promotion - i.e. selection of case studies to identify appropriate technologies to be implemented and to measure energy savings - to strategy thinking and writing with the view to contributing to the new i2010 strategy for sustainable growth. **** Contact information **** BERHAULT Gilles Parc d'activitÃ©s - 84120 La Bastidonne FRANCE Tel. +33490075326 Fax. -";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP-2007.4.2 - Supporting sustainable growth";" Euro 0.42m";" Euro 0.41m";" 225024";" From 01/10/2008 to 01/04/2011";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme CIP-ICT-PSP-TN CIP-Thematic Network ";"17";"8"

With more than 60% of the population surfing the Internet and nearly all of their data being processed online in governmental and enterprise processes, the risk of discriminatory profiling, surveillance, ID-theft, and fraud, amongst others, become omnipresent. The European commission has given this a high priority and has spent significant funds on research in this field, such as the DISCREET- Project, the OPEN-TC-Project, and the PRIME-Project in FP6, as well as its follow-up PrimeLife in FP7. The commission has also been promoting the use of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies, recommending action in a variety of areas (cf. Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Promoting Data Protection by Privacy Enhanced Technologies (PETs), COM (2007)228). The European Privacy Open Space (PrivacyOS) brings together industry, SMEs, Government, Academia, and Civil Society to foster development and deployment of privacy infrastructures for Europe. It follows the Open Space Methodology, offering a flexible structure to tackle the emerging and dynamic issues of data protection in the information age. Through a series of (non- )conferences starting in April 2008 participants will exchange research and best practises, as well as developing strategies and joint projects following four core policy goals: Awareness-raising, enabling privacy on the Web, fostering privacy-friendly Identity Management, and stipulating research.

In-Time provides mainly 3 services: Business- to-business services will enable European-wide Traffic Information Service Providers (TISPs) to get access to regional traffic and travel data and services of the single pilot cities via a harmonised standardised open interface. This will enable the TISP to provide interoperable and multimodal RTTI services (e-services) to their end-users. E-services will influence the on-trip travel behaviour by optimising journeys taking the energy consumption into account. The community will be the users of mobile devices or navigational devices. Web based interoperable and intermodal pre-trip information will be provided by the pilot operators and has the potential to influence the travel behaviour in the trip planning stage by taking environmental aspects into account. The typical users are persons that are planning an urban trip on short term. Central part of the In-Time concept is an interoperable and multimodal Regional Data/Service Server (RDSS) which can be seen as a service-oriented middleware infrastructure providing a number of data/services, covering individual traffic, public transport, weather, location based services, intermodal transport planning, and enables the operation of the In-Time services The In-Time solution with the commonly agreed standardised interface will be set up at 6 European pilot sites to ensure the easy access of real-time multimodal traffic data for external TISPs. This model ensures the easy access to all urban traffic related data within one region resulting in the distribution to the end-users via several consistent information channels. **** Contact information **** BOEHM Martin DONAU-CITY-STRASSE 1 1220 WIEN AUSTRIA Tel. +43-1-2633444-63 Fax. +43-1-2633444-10";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" ICT-PSP.2008.2.2 - ICT for adaptive urban transport management infrastructure and services";" Euro 4.58m";" Euro 2.29m";" 238880";" From 01/04/2009 to 31/03/2012";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"21";"8"

The project will deliver a model that is simple, attractive and effective enough for users to actively and consistently engage with. Pilots will involve public buildings from 5 major European Cities (Helsinki, Manchester, Lisbon, Lulea and Leiden) that will demonstrate the extent to which tangible emissions reduction is achievable. The 5 pilots will use electronic sensors to measure energy usage, plug adapters between wall sockets and the devices that plugs into them will use the mains electricity as both a power source and means of communication, measure the energy used by devices, and communicate this to a local âgatewayâ system with a web interface. The information of a network of sensors will be gathered by a central server allowing for the data analysis and identification of consumption patterns and real time view, providing an action plan to adjust the energy usage pattern and hence, the carbon footprint. A given public space will become better informed of their energy profile and be given advice on adapting behavior. The pilots implementation will follow the Living Lab methodology, involving large communities of motivated citizens co-creating ideas, decisions and recommendations in the open innovation environment of SAVE ENERGY. This core group of Living Labs will collaborate along the project and will launch a Thematic European Network of Living Labs cities focused on Energy Efficiency and Sustainability.

Studies show the benefits of these services on processes reduction and ease, better government interaction, and wider use of services. These outstanding services can be replicated in other EU cities, adapting to local culture and needs. Current services are clearly limited, the new citizen is asking for adequate response to their needs. It can definitely be reached with new technology solutions (intelligent, adaptable, human sensitive, learning capable, etc.). They meet at the same time, citizensâ and government expectations. Similar services will be critical for EU Citizenship, contributing to higher sense of belonging and mobility. Reducing burdens has been a major government effort from mid 90s. But main changes are to be made with the use of latest research findings and technology. Old technology solutions created important resistances to change. Public employees canât trust anymore promises for modernization. In 2009 managers should definitely commit to modernization. From our experience by piloting iSAC in several cities, collaborative work environments, intelligent and flexible tools, are able to drive government staff higher public service feelings and better involvement, definitely building trust and confidence in a modern administration and a responsible government. iSAC is a citizen centric system created by listening citizens and based on learning from existing services in Catalonia from 1988. It is now on-line, an automated system allowing for a human specialist if not satisfied. There is always a human being behind the automated system. iSAC6+ is intended to offer iSAC as the EU common SAC platform to: ease administration for all, citizens and business, access for all according to their capacities.

To achieve this objective BEST Energy project will implement and validate four pilots, two related to energy efficiency in public buildings (one in a Sports centre in Spain and one in a University building in Germany), and another two regarding energy efficiency in public street lighting. All the pilots will implement innovative advanced control mechanisms allowing to substantially improve the energy efficiency in the respective buildings and spaces, each of them particularized to the specific characteristics of the different buildings and spaces. The initially quantified objective is to achieve a 12% reduction on the energy consumption of the buildings, and at least a 30% reduction of the energy consumption of the public lighting systems. This objective will be reviewed after the initial stage of the project, when more detailed information about the energy use and the different possibilities of reducing the energy consumption will be available. An additional set of objectives will be defined at this stage of the project, regarding energy consumption peaks reduction, and renewable energy use (in the public buildings). Based on these experiences there will be a later replication of the pilot in other buildings, located in Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The aim is to experiment during the BEST Energy project a first replication of the pilot experiences, that will serve other Municipalities to take advantage of the results of the first phase of the project as best practices, achieving the corresponding energy savings. **** Contact information **** JORGE Elisabeth CALLE CAMINO 2 20004 Donostia - San Sebastian SPAIN Tel. +34-943483426 Fax. +34-943481669";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" ICT-PSP.2008.2.1 - ICT for energy efficiency in public building and spaces, including lighting";" Euro 4.52m";" Euro 2.26m";" 238889";" From 01/02/2009 to 30/04/2012";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"13";"5"

"project-238904";"LongLastingMemories: Long Lasting Memories";"**** A unified solution for cognitive and physical health and autonomous living for senior citizens. **** Long Lasting Memories (LLM) is an EU project aiming at an integrated ICT platform which combines state-of-the-art cognitive exercises with physical activity in the framework of an advanced ambient assisted living environment. By combining cognitive exercises and physical activity LLM delivers an effective countermeasure against age-related cognitive decline, thus actively improving the quality of life of the elderly and significantly prolonging the time they can remain independent at home, while respecting ethical and legal boundaries. The LLM service can be installed in individual homes, day care centres, or more formal medical settings, enabling the accident-free, personalized and monitored physical and cognitive training of its users. Meanwhile, users are able to take advantage of the features of an independent living solution. This is accomplished by home automations that compensate for the disabilities of people with cognitive problems or mild dementia during their daily activities. Finally, an elaborate distributed sensor network guarantees immediate response in case of an emergency, by calling for help through public telephone lines (in case of home installations), or issuing alerts to onsite caregivers (in case of other installations). Project activities During the project, the LLM service will be tested in real life situations in order to consolidate requirements and validate functionality of the solution. To achieve consistency of requirements and specifications across the whole value chain, the consortium contains a multidisciplinary team of partners encompassing a broad spectrum, from technology development to service providers, and including public authorities from each country that have responsibilities in the relevant area of care or supply of services. Four consecutive rounds of testing will take place in 5 EU Member countries (Austria, France, Greece, Spain, and the UK) for a period of 15 months, thus aiming for a wide impact on the entire Union. Effective cooperation of public authorities and private institutions will be pursued through extensive dissemination activities as an effort to promote a business model based on public-private-partnership. Testing will be focused upon elderly volunteers who will be screened and monitored throughout the course of the trials to provide high quality data quantifying the results of the LLM solution. In addition, the testing participants will provide feedback to help improve the solution. Testing will be conducted in accordance with relevant regulations for the protection of the participants; all test protocols will utilise good ethical practices and comply with European and national legislation. **** Contact information **** BAMIDIS Panagiotis University Campus, P.O.Box 323 . 54124 Thessaloniki GREECE Tel. +30 2310 999310 Fax. +30 2310 999263";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2008.1.4 - ICT for ageing well with cognitive problems, combining assistive and independent living technologies";" Euro 4.72m";" Euro 2.36m";" 238904";" From 01/06/2009 to 31/03/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"12";"7"

The project fits with objective 1.6 of the 2nd Call for Proposals for the CIP-ICT PSP program: âImproving certification of eHealth productsâ, more specifically where the work program refers to the âgood practice requirements as elaborated by EuroRecâ, Most national health authorities are willing to improve the quality, the functionality and the interoperability of the existing systems on their market. Users of those systems would like to rely on a quality label when acquiring such an EHR system. Suppliers of the systems understand that quality assurance can even be profitable for their business. Starting certification nevertheless requires perseverance as it is often difficult to deploy. EuroRec is offering tools to facilitate this deployment. A number of sometimes essential stakeholders on the other hand still needs to be convinced. This project promotes certification by organising national workshops in 27 different European countries, by validating the EuroRec functional statements (over 1.400 statements), translating a substantial set of them in over 20 different European languages and by validating the EuroRec certification tools and certification procedures. The focus functionalities of the validation and the translations to be addressed during the project will be on medicinal product prescriptions, on medication management, on summary records as well as on generic statements regarding reliability and trustworthiness of the systems and on security and access management. The project will also deliver two complementary reports.

The services will improve the elderly ability for self-care by support for their basic daily activities in way that prevents health risks in their homes. The services will also strengthen the daily interaction with their social sphere - partners and relatives, friends and care-givers, giving them the feeling of safety and preventing their social isolation. Last but not least, their cognitive training and activation will be strengthened. To prove wide applicability in Europe, the pilot will be validated and tested in realistic conditions for 12-month period in four Member States regions which have extensive experience from existing telehomecare services for elderly. The pilot set of services will integrate: a) several partial services, b) already tested prototype, and c) completed R&amp;D work. The operation will be evaluated with three target end-user groups - elderly, formal and informal caregivers, addressing thus the diverse requirements of these groups. The pilot service will contain 3 different service bundles (basic services, intermediate and high level) that allow for escalation of the service provided to the end-users based on their needs and providing different pricing schemes. The ISISEMD pilot has strong user centric focus and offers a wide range of individual activities that will allow for the e-Inclusion of the elderly people in every day social life. In the final period of the project, usability, business and cost-benefit analysis of the pilot will be carried out. ISISEMD is an expert consortium of 12 partners, built on public-private partnership. **** Contact information **** OLESEN Kjeld Bundgaard Avenue de Tervuren 35 1040 Brussels DENMARK Tel. +32 2 282 0371 Fax. +32 2 230 9015";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2008.1.4 - ICT for ageing well with cognitive problems, combining assistive and independent living technologies";" Euro 4.52m";" Euro 2.26m";" 238914";" From 01/03/2009 to 31/08/2011";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"15";"5"

The lighting service delivered is compliant with road classes CE2-CE5, S- and A- according to the standard of EN13201. That means that our device can be installed in secondary street, commercial access, allotment, pedestrian way, cycle track. It is compliant with ll electric standards for luminaires general requirements and tests as well. The core element of the solution is the dimming of the lamp depending on the environment; a set of embedded sensors measure ambient light, temperature, current, and detect motion. Output data of sensors is then processed by the embedded intelligence allowing optimum regulation of light levels. The members within the consortium have been carefully selected to cover the entire value- chain of the project and the standardisation as well. They are all convinced about the prosperous future for this technology, its significant energy saving potential up to 70 %, environmental and economical benefits and the increased level of traffic safety for the public. The objectives will be achieved by the manufacture of a lantern specially designed to receive the LED array and the embedded intelligence. The piloted, full members of the consortium as well, will procure their sets of lanterns to a subcontractor of the consortium in charge of the industrialisation of LITES. To obtain significant change in the demand for intelligent street lighting, current facts and results about LITES will be presented in conferences, in fairs, in scientific and non-scientific magazines, on website, in three video presentations on technical, financial, and organizational issues on LITES technology implementation. Each video will gather the experience in four pilot sites. There will be developed the adapted versions for each pilot country (France, Portugal, Latvia, and Poland). The adapted version will include the introduction presented by local expert from LITES team. The European content will be complemented with subscripts in LITES partner country language. **** Contact information **** LUZARRAGA Didier Rue de la Porte du ChÃ¢teau 106 16430 Champniers FRANCE Tel. +33608943940 Fax. +33545657412";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" ICT-PSP.2008.2.1 - ICT for energy efficiency in public building and spaces, including lighting";" Euro 2.56m";" Euro 1.28m";" 238916";" From 01/12/2009 to 31/05/2012";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"8";"6"

In this context, three main groups of people are being addressed: a) elderly poor and retired seniors; b) youngsters not in education, employment and training (NEET), and non-EU teenagers that are integrating into a local community with their families or by themselves; c) individual civil servants from small or medium size local governments, mainly those administrations that do not pertain to large metropolitan areas and suffer the digital divide. The ADD ME! network is formed by a relevant number of organisations from 8 European countries interested in building a strong network to empower organisations working on daily basis with disadvantaged groups in the use of government services that make use of the information and communication technologies. The community of practice being launched by the network is open to social and institutional intermediaries, such as: the different levels of administrations, especially those acting locally (where near 70% of the eGovernment services are provided); NGOs, associations, labour unions and other social organisations and institutions supporting disadvantaged groups (like foundations and charities); as well as private institutions willing to support social inclusion programmes. The strategy of the network is most flexible and multi-channelling, taking into account that intermediaries use and combine different ways to approach public and local services: from more traditional channels as face to face, telephone and post to more innovative ICT enabled services like the web, tele-kiosks, mobile phones and inter-active TV, etc. **** Contact information **** MEDAGLIA Carlo Maria Piazzale Aldo Moro 5 00185 ROMA ITALY Tel. +39-06-49910892 Fax. +39-06-4456696";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" ICT-PSP.2008.1.5.1 - Capacity building for eInclusion - Capacity building for inclusive access to on-line public services";" Euro 0.43m";" Euro 0.43m";" 238917";" From 01/11/2009 to 31/10/2011";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"21";"9"
"project-238930";"FREILOT: Urban Freight Energy Efficiency Pilot";"Transportation of goods is a key enabler for European economy to maintain its competitiveness. However, the same transportation brings other, less positive effects, such as CO2 emissions, contributing to the global gas house effect. Therefore, reduction of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and emissions of other pollutants is one of the biggest challenges for the road transport today. The specific energy consumption of a goods vehicle in urban areas depends on many factors such as vehicle performance, driver behaviour, traffic control strategies and performance, weight of the vehicle and its load, urban geography and the road network, etc. Clearly, all of these aspects can not be addressed by one single solution, (e.g. optimizing truck engine or providing better route guidance). An âefficientâ truck is not as âefficientâ if it needs to stop at every traffic light. Therefore, the FREILOT consortium has developed a new approach to deal with this issue where four of the above mentioned factors will be addressed: - Traffic management (intersection control optimised for energy efficiency) - Vehicle (Acceleration and adaptive speed limiters) - Driver (Enhanced âeco drivingâ support) - Fleet management (Real-time loading/ delivery space booking) The basic idea is that cities will give priority at traffic lights, on certain roads or during certain times of the day, to the trucks that follow FREILOT scheme. The trucks eligible for this would be equipped with acceleration/speed limiters and eco-driving support for the drivers. In addition, a delivery space booking system will be made available for those trucks in order to avoid double parking or âdrive around the block âbehaviour. All four elements present in the pilot would be contributing to the reduction of the fuel consumption and reduction of emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. The main goal of the pilot is to show that up to 25% reduction of fuel consumption in urban areas can be achieved through FREILOT scheme. **** Contact information **** JEFTIC Zeljko Avenue Louise 326 326 1050 BRUXELLES BELGIUM Tel. +32 2 4000731 Fax. +32 2 4000701";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2008.2.2 - ICT for adaptive urban transport management infrastructure and services";" Euro 3.99m";" Euro 2.00m";" 238930";" From 01/04/2009 to 30/09/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"20";"7"
"project-238933";"HosPilot: Intelligent Energy Efficiency Control in Hospitals";"The concern of European society for the well being of its residents and the sustainability of the environment has led to the consciousness that energy savings need to be at the top of the political agenda. Until recently, the focus of energy reduction has been on schools and offices. Hospitals, however, also use large amounts of energy. Therefore, the project will address specifically the hospital domain. HosPilot will address the two main technology areas Lighting and HVAC, thus covering the largest part of the energy consuming areas. By adding intelligence, ICT will play a vital role to achieve significant energy reduction in the complex environment of a hospital. The main goal of HosPilot is to prove that the proposed energy reduction service leads to reduced energy consumption and improved level of comfort for the end users. This goal will by achieved by identifying requirements of hospitals with respect to the building, its surroundings and its usage; designing a generic methodology addressing the needs, yielding the most energy efficient solution. The methodology will be interlinked with expert knowledge of the various technologies into one holistic energy saving service. Three pilots will be executed in hospitals during normal operation. HosPilot will provide the most advanced ICT technology for future replications at European level. The HosPilot project will support the decision makers with an ICT based service that will drastically reduce the energy consumption of newly built hospitals and existing hospitals being refurbished, increasing well being and comfort. The consortium comprises the required players, â lighting and healthcare industry, industry (including SME) and applied research organisations on energy efficient building construction, system integration and clinical sites â and makes sure that appropriate knowledge is available to introduce the new service.

While people with disabilities find it hard to communicate with the existing solutions, REACH112 will provide modes of communication so that they will find a way to communicate in each situation, may it be with a live real-time text conversation, with sign language, with lip reading, with voice or with any simultaneous combination of these modes described by the concept of Total Conversation. The service will be of benefit for all. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need to improve access to emergency services for people with disabilities in the EU. REACH112 will implement a 12- month pilot in Sweden, UK, The Netherlands, France and Spain allowing disabled users to communicate at a distance with each other and directly with the emergency services. IP devices will be provided in the homes, workplaces and on the move, connecting the users simultaneously in video, voice and text. Users will be able to connect between countries and different service providers, on mobile and fixed IP networks. They will also connect through a third-party service (relay) with voice telephone users. The service will be integrated with existing telecommunication platforms and emergency service frameworks. Additionally, a protocol for the exchange of information between emergency services will be made available so that relevant data can be transferred to the most appropriate emergency service. REACH112 will therefore become a blueprint for the extension of IP-based communications, Total Conversation and emergency services in the EU.

In most cases these queries are just unstructured fragments of text in a specific language. The first service offered by GALATEAS (LangLog) is focussed on getting meaning out of these lists of queries and it is addressed to library/federation/site managers. Contrary to mainstream service in this field, GALATEAS services will not considered standard structured information of web logs (e.g. click rate, visited pages, userâs paths inside the document tree) but the information contained in queries from the point of view of language interpretation. By subscribing LangLog federations administrator and managers will be able to answer questions such as: as âWhich are the topics which are most commonly searched in my collection, according to a certain language?â; âhow do these topics relate with my catalogue?â; âWhich named entities (people, places) are more popular among my users?â. The second problem addressed by GALATEAS is the one of Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) i.e. the capability of typing a query in one specific language and retrieving documents which are available in different languages. The CACAO consortium is already successfully providing services for indexing and searching over digital libraries and metadata repositories. During commercial exploration for marketing CACAO it emerged that certain institutions prefer to keep indexing and searching at their premises (using their own favourite search engine) and would be perfectly satisfied with a service of plain query translation.The second service offered by GALATEAS (QueryTrans) has the ambitious and innovative goal of providing the first web translation service specially tailored on query translation. **** Contact information **** LAGOS Nikolaos Chemin de Maupertuis 6 38240 Meylan FR Tel. +33 (0) 4 76 61 51 92 Fax. +33(4) 76 61 51 99";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.5.1 - Multilingual Web: Machine translation for the multilingual web";" Euro 3.70m";" Euro 1.85m";" 250430";" From 01/04/2010 to 31/03/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"8";"5"

Recently the national databases were linked into a European portal (EASTIN). Search technology relies mainly on classification ISO 9999: âTechnical aids for persons with disabilitiesâ. Drawbacks of the current solution are: â¢ Users must know the structure of the classification system to search successfully; this prevents occasional users from success; â¢ Users must know language and special terminology of the info base (national databases are language-specific); this means prohibitively high access costs; â¢ Access requires skills in keyboard input and display output; no other interaction modes exist. This restricts the access for (sometimes disabled) end users, for whom the technology is intended. The project will improve access to assistive information by: â¢ providing cross-lingual retrieval, and machine translation for both queries and documents. The translation components will support Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Hungarian, hitherto not sufficiently supported in the EASTIN framework. Both query translation and result translation will be offered, tuned for the assistive domain â¢ improving the ease-of-use of the interface, to support non-expert users â¢ improving the accessibility to the information base offering audio input and output for some languages. The result will lead to an improved service with higher visibility in Europe for both professionals and end users. **** Contact information **** BUSCH Reinhard GOTTFRIED-KELLER-STRASSE 12 D-81245 MUENCHEN GERMANY Tel. +49 89 896664 0 Fax. -+ 49 89 88919933";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.5.1 - Multilingual Web: Machine translation for the multilingual web";" Euro 2.15m";" Euro 1.08m";" 250432";" From 01/03/2010 to 31/05/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"5";"4"

In the scope of these pilots RFID-ROI-SME will: -Study the potential benefits of RFID deployment in various sectors. Accordingly, the project will produce blueprints and case studies tailored to the particular sector and on the basis of genuine trial experiences. -Identify and showcase innovative business cases in various sectors. The aim will be to demonstrate the innovative aspects and the added- value of RFID systems, processes and applications, over conventional systems and processes. -Showcase integrated RFID application scenarios, across the full value chain of RFID enabled projects and services. Such scenarios will be transnational. -Demonstrate the potential benefits of RFID technology for the EU citizens, based on a set of citizen centric deployments (i.e. dealing with products and services of interest to the citizen). -Deploy pilots for RFID end- users on the basis of an SME centric approach, which takes into account the special needs of the SME. To this end, RFID-ROI-SME adopts an SMEs for the SMEs approach i.e. innovative SME solution providers will be deploying pilots for SME end-users. -Demonstrate the fact that Open Source RFID products can be used for realistic deployments, in a way that minimizew the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of RFID solutions, without depriving the deployments of any essential features. **** Contact information **** TOFFALETTI Sebastiano RUE JACQUES LALAING 4 1040 BRUXELLES BELGIUM Tel. 0032 2 282 0538 Fax. 0032 2 230 78 61";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.7.2 - Internet evolution and security (including RFID) : Strengthening SME competitive advantage through RFID implementation";" Euro 4.40m";" Euro 2.20m";" 250438";" From 01/03/2010 to 29/02/2012";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"20";"7"
"project-250444";"RFID-F2F: RFID from Farm to Fork";"The pilot aims at showcasing to SMEs in the food sector what is needed in terms of technology, business processes, skills and management for an RFID implementation delivering in-house business value and identifying which food information is required to fulfil society&apos;s, citizens and/ or organisations needs. Related to this call for pilot projects, the European Commission funds through the FP7 RTD programme, the project ASPIRE29 which develops new middleware software solutions for RFIDs that will be distributed to SMEs under open source and royalty free conditions. This should lower the total cost of ownership of RFID applications and SMEs will no longer have to bear the costs for acquiring licences of software proprietary systems for RFID. In general, pilot proposals might take advantage of ongoing EU research in this area. The network of excellence EuroFIR, funded under the EU FP6 &apos;Food Quality and Safety Programme&apos; acts in the field of food information and will therefore have importance for this project. The objective of the European Food Information Resource Project (EuroFIR) is to develop and integrate comprehensive, coherent and validated database providing a single, authoritative source of food composition data in Europe. The food business is one that provides huge potential for demonstration of return on investment for RFID. The technology has been proven to provide a return: By providing authentication of the origin of foodstuffs, thereby increasing customer confidence and allowing access to premium markets By reducing wastage and optimising logistics costs By increasing quality of goods to the customer However, it is hard for SMEs to realise this return. Unlike major producers and retailers, they do not have control over the whole business process, and therefore cannot deploy the technology, along with the ancillary data systems, to allow the RoI to be realised. **** Contact information **** HORNAK Marek Wulfruna Street WV11SB WOLVERHAMPTON UNITED KINGDOM Tel. +44 (0) 1952 288208 Fax. +44 (0) 1952 288214";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.7.2 - Internet evolution and security (including RFID) : Strengthening SME competitive advantage through RFID implementation";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" 250444";" From 01/05/2010 to 30/04/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"11";"6"
"project-250445";"CARARE: Connecting ARchaeology and ARchitecture in Europeana";"CARARE is a proposal to establish over 3 years a Best Practice Network and aggregation service and improve the interoperability with Europeana of the digital content available from the archaeology and architectural heritage domain. It will involve heritage organisations, archaeological museums and specialist archives to expand Europeanaâs network of content providers and make available the rich diversity of content for unique archaeological monuments, historic buildings and town centres. Distributed 2D and 3D content for heritage places will be brought together and linked up in Europeana with this critical mass of geographically referenced content creating the potential for new map-based commercial and public services for tourism, education and research to be set up. CARARE will work with the EDL Foundation to establish efficient processes to aggregate contents from heritage organisations, addressing practical issues relating to the harvesting of 3D/VR formats, the rich semantics of archaeology and architecture content and the handling of geographic information. The network will implement the protocols, standards and schemas recommended for Europeana contributing expertise on 3D/VR, GI, time and space to the development of the Europeana object model and semantic tools. CARARE brings together a consortium representing 20 countries and organisations with broad ranging experience of the heritage sector, digital libraries, standards and aggregation services. It will make around 2 million items available with information for approximately 1 million unique heritage sites. The expected results include the establishment of an aggregator service for Europeana underpinned by a network of highly interoperable repositories and a sustainable business model to continue the service in future. For end-users the results include being able to explore content for heritage sites and to discover, access and use 3D/Virtual Reality content through Europeana. **** Contact information **** HANSEN Henrik Jarl H.C.

"project-250446";"ThermoMap: Area mapping of superficial geothermic resources by soil and groundwater data";"Variations of temperature and heat flow in depth up to 10m are predominantly controlled by external variables like sun radiation and infiltration of rainfall and internal soil conditions like soil grain size, soil matter and mixture of soil substances, absorptive capacity, etc. These low depths can be exploited in terms of geothermal power usage with cost efficient, inexpensive methods with an amortisation of the invested budget in a relatively short time period. âThermoMapâ will combine and analyse already existing data collections (geological, hydrogeological, geophysical and pedological geodata, climate, land use &amp; land cover, solar insulation, slope and aspect (both as maps and as digital data)) to calculate a value for the geothermal potential in low depths on a large to medium scale. The analysis of the geodata will be performed in a GIS-environment with standardized methods, valid for the entire EU. These methods will be intensely tested, verified and finally documented in a manual for geodata processing and analysis as future standards. The resulting geothermal potential as a georeferenced information value will be integrated in a WebGIS with a server side and a geo-visualization and information front-end. ThermoMap will provide different user-groups with an interactive information tool running in a web browser. Private users may check the potential of their own parcels, community planning and administration authorities may test the geothermal potential of their entire administrative unit. Researchers, participating in ThermoMap, will have access to the entire geo-data pool. ThermoMap will be established for several participating EU member countries in a first step. Therefore each project partner will define a test-area in its country. The processing methods developed for the geodata in these test areas and the analysis standards developed in ThermoMap can later be adapted to the area of the entire EU and may provide a significant value for energy saving. **** Contact information **** HOFFMANN Ulrike Schlossplatz 4 91054 ERLANGEN GERMANY Tel. +49 9131 85 24043 Fax. +49 9131 85 26239";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.6.2 - Public Sector information : Geographic Information";" Euro 3.87m";" Euro 1.93m";" 250446";" From 01/09/2010 to 31/08/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"11";"8"

HSH intends to achieve this by providing a comprehensive set of services which support elders in their daily activities and allows carers to remotely assess their ability to stay independent. While systems of this kind inevitably represent an intrusion in the eldersâ private life, HSH privileges features which can be used by the elders themselves and limits to a bare minimum the need for other people to interfere with their private life unless a clear need is detected by the system. It comprises the following services: Monitoring and Alarm Handling, eInclusion, Domotic, Daily Scheduler, Navigation and Mental Faculty Maintaining. The Monitoring and Alarm Handling is based on a DSS which analysis in real time data collected from medical and environmental sensors, fall detectors and geopositioning systems. Standard behavioural patterns are established for individuals and sudden, major changes trigger alarms. eInclusion is achieved through intuitive videoconferencing based on the familiar TV paradigm and adapted to use by people unfamiliar with IT technology. Domotics and Daily Scheduler help elders to organise their daily activities and to manage the house in spite of growing physical and mental impairments. The navigation system takes people who got lost to the closest safe place. Cognitive training is implemented through interactive games based on cognitive adaptive technology. Complexity of exercises is adjusted to the performance and current mental level of the user. The Consortium brings together best of the breed partners from Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Spain with a very strong presence of public authorities with budgetary responsibility for health and elderly care, supported by SMEs.

INSPIRE needs work here, particularly in its Annex III data themes: 16-19 (Sea regions, Bio-geographical regions, Habitats &amp; biotopes, Species distribution). To address this, the HABITATS consortium of 10 partners, including content providers, users and service providers builds a trans- European social network to generate usage scenarios and requirements and assess the impact of project outcomes, to directly feed into interactive data/metadata modelling of the four INSPIRE Annex III data themes 16-19. Widespread user validation is grounded in 7 pilot services covering these data themes across Europe &amp; led by content-providing partners. Its deeply user-driven approach to standards adoption processes permeates a 30-month workplan. The validation pilots are formed by multi-stakeholder partnerships where users actively participate in the co-design of the network services, develop on-demand for integration into the pilot service mash-up platforms. Validation pilot partnerships develop and test organisational/institutional arrangements for service sustainability and business models that underpin the projectâs exploitation strategy. Specific and realistic quantified indicators measure the envisaged improvements in availability, access and use. The HABITATS network of services allows users to identify, access, use/reuse, in an interoperable and seamless way, aggregated geographical information covering much of Europe and coming from a wide range of sources, from local to European level, resulting in: a) Data/metadata models for INSPIRE b) Network Service architecture, applet set &amp; invoking service toolkit; c) Seven validated pilot services for concrete usage scenarios; d) Service/business models and exploitation plans for long-term viability; e) HABITATS user community social network to accompany the standards adoption process &amp; spread the projectâs impact throughout Europe. **** Contact information **** SIERRA DE MIGUEL Azucena Calle JuliÃ¡n Camarillo 6B 28037 Madrid ES Tel. +34913226351 Fax. +34913226323";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.6.2 - Public Sector information : Geographic Information";" Euro 2.41m";" Euro 1.21m";" 250455";" From 01/04/2010 to 28/02/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"10";"6"
"project-250456";"LetsMT!: Platform for Online Sharing of Training Data and Building User Tailored MT";"**** Exploiting the potential of SMT technologies **** In recent years, statistical machine translation (SMT) has become the leading paradigm for machine translation. SMT systems are built by analyzing huge volumes of parallel corpus and learning translation models from this data. The quality of SMT systems largely depends on the size of training data. Since the majority of parallel data is in major languages, SMT systems for larger languages are of much better quality compared to systems for smaller languages. This quality gap is further deepened due to the complex linguistic structure of many smaller languages. Languages like Latvian, Lithuanian and Croatian (to name just a few) have complex morphological structure and free word order. To learn this complexity from corpus data, much larger volumes of training data are needed. Current systems are built on the data accessible on the web, but it is just a fraction of all parallel texts. Most of them still reside in the local systems of different corporations, public and private institutions, and desktops of individual users. The cost and the know-how required for building custom MT solutions deter many small-to-medium companies from utilizing the power of MT technologies. To fully exploit the huge potential of existing open SMT technologies we propose to build an innovative online collaborative platform for data sharing and MT building. This platform will support upload of public as well as proprietary MT training data and building of multiple MT systems, public or proprietary, by combining and prioritizing this data. The project will extend the use of existing state-of-the-art SMT methods that will be applied to data supplied by users to increase quality, scope and language coverage of machine translation. LetsMT! services will be focused on two application scenarios â the free online translation of business and financial news and the application in the localisation and translation industry. At the same time, it will be of interest for a variety of users: web users in general, speakers of less-covered languages, academia, etc. For the localisation and translation industry, LetsMT! will provide facilities for training of SMT systems on their data and generating custom SMT solutions to be used by localisation service providers as well as enterprises and organizations with multilingual translation needs. Integration of SMT solutions in professional productivity environments will be provided. For readers of business and financial news, LetsMT! will provide free and instant MT services with emphasis on less-covered languages. Their quality will be ensured by application of a large pool of domain-specific resources and subsequent evaluation cycles. LetsMT! services will be accessible through the Web portal for free translation of texts, through a translation widget provided for inclusion in a web-page, through browser plug-ins for quick access to translation, and through integration in professional translation tools. **** Contact information **** BERZINS Aivars VIENIBAS GATVE 75 A 1004 RIGA REPUBLIC OF LATVIA Tel. +37167605001 Fax. +37167605750";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.5.1 - Multilingual Web: Machine translation for the multilingual web";" Euro 3.34m";" Euro 1.67m";" 250456";" From 01/03/2010 to 31/08/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"7";"7"
"project-250467";"ATLAS: Applied Technology for Language-Aided CMS";"[Atlas]  The advent of the Web revolutionized the way in which content is manipulated and delivered. As a result, digital content in various languages has become widely available on the Internet and its sheer volume and language diversity have presented an opportunity for embracing new methods and tools for content creation and distribution. Although significant improvements have been made lately in the field of web content management, there is still a growing demand for online content services that incorporate language-based technology. Mechanisms such as automatic annotation of important words, phrases and names, text summarization and categorization, and computer-aided translation could facilitate the process of manipulating heterogeneous multilingual content as well as enhance end-user experience by allowing for better content navigation. This project unifies such mechanisms in a common software platform called ATLAS and builds three separate solutions around this platform. The first solution, i Publisher, adds a visualization layer to ATLAS and provides a powerful web- based instrument for creating, running and managing small and enterprise content-driven web sites. i Publisher will be freely available as an online service and also used by the consortium to build two thematic content-driven web sites â i Librarian and EUDocLib. i Librarian allows its users to store, organize and publish their personal works, to locate similar documents in different languages, and to obtain easily the most essential texts from large collections of unfamiliar documents. EUDocLib is a publicly accessible repository of EU documents, which provides enhanced navigation and easier access to relevant documents in the user's language. **** Contact information **** BELOGAY Anelia Prof. Nikolay Genchev 18 1700 Sofia BULGARIA Tel. 35924950444 Fax. -35924950443";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.5.3 - Multilingual Web : Multilingual Web content management: methods, tools and processes";" Euro 3.32m";" Euro 1.66m";" 250467";" From 01/03/2010 to 28/02/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"9";"6"

Pictures will be free of charge for educational or private use, duly taking into account IPR issues. An adequate resolution will be guaranteed to ensure satisfactory image quality to users, fully supporting in any case Europeana standards of quality. Pictures in these huge archives are among the most valuable historical documents of the last century. They record major domestic and international events (political, social, cultural, sporting), celebrities and daily life from the turn of the century to the mid 1990s. At present this common cultural and historical heritage is marginally accessible. Only a small fraction (2%) of the archives have been digitalised with limited availability at a national level and mostly to professional picture buyers. The project will focus on the targeted digitalisation and fully metadata enrichment of at least 150.000 pictures according to users needs, Europeana Themes and metadata standard. Moreover, agencies will make available to Europeana about 1 million of images already digitalised and captioned, currently in historical digital archives. The sustainability of the project will be based on the revenues stream coming from selling historical pictures by agencies to their current target (media industry) at an European level.

The use of GI requires re-consideration of time/ spatial accounting to achieve optimality geo-processing services essential in environmental management, as demanded by planners and decision makers. With a few exceptions, current guidelines & standards do not provide such a support whilst funded by EC programmes or initiatives as GMES, eContentPlus and INSPIRE. It is the aim of BRISEIDE to fill-in this gap. BRISEIDE will be applied, tested and validated within a Civil Protection application context, using the INSPIRE relevant themes, via a chain of stakeholders, data providers, technology partners, and downstream users. The Pilot operational phase will last 12 months and will consider real life events, with extensions in additional domains, being considered and assessed. Civil Protection operators and Public Administrations, engaged in urban planning, resource & environmental management, need spatio-temporal processing of GI to support decision-making. Current SDIs and the ESDI offer no or very limited time variable management. The integration between INSPIRE-compliant geographic datasets and operational databases, essential in domains such as environmental risk management and civil protection, is poor. Thus the present scope of services SDI can offer is somewhat limited.

Unfortunately, despite the initiatives which have already been carried out and others that are being carried out at present moment, there is no valid data harmonization model for the Land Cover and Land Use datasets, taking into account both the data categorization and the data model and the end usersâ specificities, which could be valid for all the application areas and at a European level. The HLANDATA project aims at making a significant step forward in overcoming the aforementioned barrier, fostering the use of the Land Use and Land Cover geographic data at a European level, through the creation of value- added European services. The main objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasible European level harmonization of the Land Use and Land Cover datasets taking into account both the data categorization and the data models, for any of their possible uses and users, through the development of user oriented value-added services. In order to achieve this objective, newly developed web services will be used for the implementation of 3 pilot projects in 3 different application areas, which will be used to validate the harmonization proposal made: â¢ PILOT 1: Land Use- Land Cover Data Analysis System for intermediate-level users â¢ PILOT 2: Harmonized and Interoperable Land Information Systems â¢ PILOT 3: Stratification of waste dumps Each of the pilot projects will result on a Land Use model for a specific application area. The assessment of the results of these pilot projects and the related Land Use models will lead to the generation of a harmonized Land Use Classification scheme and a methodology for the harmonization of the Land Use datasets. **** Contact information **** SOLA Delia Ctra.

The project focus lies on local areas where empowerment of civil servants and their administrations is vital to ensure the implementation of digital inclusion policies targeting socially disadvantaged. The project also addresses the acquisition of skills needed to improve their own competence in the management and use of ICT, to modernise the organisations of the public administration and efficiently deliver eGovernment and other local services. On the other hand, it consists in the realisation of five specific pilot actions in several European Member States (Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and UK) to validate the training and empowerment instruments created by the CEMSDI network of eGovernment experts. This wide piloting phase will enable to extension of the methodology throughout the European Union. The pilots will focus on civil servants in small and medium local governments serving around 8.000 inhabitants or less. The instrument used will be the DLA (Digital Local Agenda). The DLA was launched in June 2005 through the European conference of local and regional governments known as EISCO, with the participation of more than 25 European countries. It is an inclusive working instrument to improve the deployment of eGovernment as a system in the territories, leaving no administration and citizen behind. **** Contact information **** STINELLI Francesca Via Giacomo Peroni 386 00131 Roma ITALY Tel. +39 06 400 40 358 Fax. +39 06 400 40 364";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.3.3 - ICT for government and governance : Inclusive eGovernance: flexible, personalised and multi-channel based service delivery targeted at the socially disadvantaged.";" Euro 5.18m";" Euro 2.59m";" 250482";" From 01/06/2010 to 31/05/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"12";"6"

The thinkMOTION project helps to make a significant improvement in the quantity and quality of digital content and establishes a new kind of digital library in Europeana with focus on technical knowledge. It covers both the cradle of technical knowledge of mankind and the rapid technical progress. The collected material will be processed and presented immediately in a multilingual interactive portal via Europeana. Here, the techno-cultural heritage and the current developments in motion science will be preserved and made accessible for a wide range of European user groups like interested laymen, engineers, scientists, lecturers, students. The provided interactive material leads to a deeper understanding and motivates to learn more about the scientific and technical background in a European society of lifelong learning. Very different types of content like textual sources, physical models and drawings will be collected by partners in several European countries whereby the connections to the national communities and institutions ease the acquisition of content and the rights of use. In the library, new ways of content representation, information retrieval (supported by a multilingual semantic network) and cross linking are supported. The thinkMOTION project as part of the Europeana has also a worldwide dimension. It allows the first publication of forgotten &quot;treasures&quot; to honour the creative genius of the countless European inventors and engineers, which have enabled the technical progress and our high standard of living. It is time to accept that the European cultural heritage is not only defined by artworks or philosophic and religious essays but also defined by technical developments.

"project-250487";"RENEWING HEALTH: REgioNs of Europe WorkINg toGether for HEALTH";"RENEWING HEALTH aims at implementing large-scale real-life test beds for the validation and subsequent evaluation of innovative telemedicine services using a patient-centred approach and a common rigorous assessment methodology. In 9 of the most advanced regions in the implementation of health-related ICT services, belonging to 9 different Member States or Associated Countries, service solutions are already operational at local level for the telemonitoring and the treatment of chronic patients suffering from diabetes, COPD or CVD diseases. The services are designed to give patients a central role in the management of their diseases, fine-tuning the choice and dosage of medications, promoting compliance to treatment, and helping healthcare professionals to detect early signs of worsening. These services will be scaled up, integrated with mainstream Health Information Systems, grouped into a limited number of clusters bringing together services showing similar features, trialled and assessed with a rigorous and common assessment methodology, and using a common set of primary indicators for pilots belonging to a same cluster. The methodology used for the assessment will be based as much as possible on FAST , a methodology currently in the final definition stage of definition by partners of the RENEWING HEALTH Consortium under contract from the European Commission. However in view of the novelty of FAST which has never been tested before on real cases, the Consortium feels free to amend or complete it as required to suit the specific needs of RENEWING HEALTH. Although integration of the service solutions at regional level is the highest priority for the Project partners, the use of international standards and the progressive convergence towards common interoperable architectures will be equally sought to prepare and facilitate their subsequent scaling up at national and European levels. Each cluster of pilots will operate as a multi-centre clinical trial measuring the efficiency and the cost effectiveness of the implemented solutions, giving scientific validity to the results of the trials and so promoting the adoption of remote patient monitoring and treatment on a large scale. The Project is supported by the Health Authorities of the participating regions which have responsibility for the healthcare budget; they are fully committed to deploy the telemedicine services in their territory, once they have been validated on a large scale and their positive cost/benefit ratio has been demonstrated, and also to co-operate among themselves and with other European initiatives with similar objectives to promote the further uptake of the services at pan- European level. The Consortium includes eight regions officially endorsed by Member States for their participation in the RENEWING HEALTH . This of course paves the way for the countrywide deployment of telemedicine telemedicine services derived from RENEWING HEALTH in these Member States and even beyond. **** Contact information **** DARIO Claudio Borgo Cavalli 42 31100 Treviso ITALY Tel. +39 0422 323217 Fax. +39 0422 547664";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.1.1 - ICT for health, ageing and inclusion: ICT for patient-centred health service";" Euro 14.11m";" Euro 7.00m";" 250487";" From 01/02/2010 to 30/09/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PA Pilot Type A ";"20";"11"

This would be achieved by piloting in several social housing buildings the interaction between smart devices and the users to create, in a first approach, awareness around their energy consumption and therefore a change in their energy-use patterns. This energy ICT-based management service pilot pretends to be a first real and direct relationship between promoters and social housing consumers. Furthermore, for utilities, it could be the seed that would evolve towards new business models based on dynamic pricing and flexible tariffs that could partially avoid the use of the energy in the most expensive periods, resulting in flatter power demand loads and indirectly in a reduction of energy consumption. This would have to be offered (real case scenario) under a wider portfolio of services for the customer. i.e. Security services (i.e. on/off of the lighting systems when on holidays), programming capacity of their HVAC systems, scheduling of different loads (washing machines, dish-washers, pool pumps, etc.), Maintenance support from manufactures, and a endless list of opportunities. Thus, this kind of projects is a means of showing and demonstrating, not only the advantages that a consumer can be provided with at home, but also the potential that the promoter can benefit from this profile changing. Not to mention the environmental benefits all in all by reducing peak demand and energy consumption that incur unavoidably in a CO2 reduction. This would leverage the Regulatory Authorities to take action in order to promote these services for the climate change benefit. **** Contact information **** GONZÃLEZ Alejandra AVENIDA SAN LUIS 77 MADRID SPAIN Tel. +34 635512544 Fax. +34 912015168";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.4.1 - ICT for energy efficiency, environment and smart mobility : ICT for energy efficiency in social housing";" Euro 4.00m";" Euro 2.00m";" 250491";" From 01/02/2010 to 31/01/2013";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"8";"4"

In order to build on current internationalization of the Web and move it forward, it is important to raise awareness of existing best practices and standards related to managing content on the multilingual Web, and look forward to what remains to be done. The project is coordinated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization of currently over 400 members worldwide from research and industry, headed by the Web&apos;s inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The other partners represent stakeholders from a range of affected areas. The project will last for two years. At the core will be four workshops, led by the partners but open to public participation. The dissemination of information and discussions arising from the network will be supported by publicly archived mailing lists and other tools such as a wiki, a twitter stream, etc. Information and announcements will be on the W3C web site, which will guarantee high visibility and stable long-term access by the public. Partners will also provide input to practical initiatives that will be carried out in parallel at the W3C. Two face-to-face meetings and a mailing list are planned to facilitate these discussions. These initiatives are aimed at supporting the development of the multilingual Web by providing an online internationalization validator, training materials related to web internationalization, and results for a test suite for internationalization features of major browsers. The actual work on those initiatives is not funded by the Thematic Network, however these initiatives provide a channel for the network to extend its influence far beyond the end of the project. **** Contact information **** MICHEL Jessica 2004, ROUTE DES LUCIOLES SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS 06410 BIOT FRANCE Tel. +33 4 92 38 50 10 Fax. +33 4 92 38 50 11";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.5.2 - Multilingual Web : Multilingual Web content management: standards and best practices";" Euro 0.41m";" Euro 0.41m";" 250500";" From 01/04/2010 to 31/03/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"20";"13"

National efforts have led to the digitisation of large quantities of mathematical literature, primarily by partners in this project. Publishers produce new material that needs to be archived safely over the long term, made more visible, usable, and interoperable with the legacy corpus on which it settles. In EuDML, these partners will join together with leading technology providers in constructing the Europe-wide interconnections between their collections to create a document network as integrated and trans-national as the discipline of mathematics itself. They will future-proof their work by providing the organisational and technical infrastructure to accommodate new collections and mathematically rich metadata formats, and will work towards truly open access for the whole European Community to this foundational resource, thereby retaining Europe's leadership in the provision, accessibility and exploitation of electronic mathematical content. EuDML will design and build a collaborative digital library service that will collate the currently distributed content by the diversity of providers. This will be achieved by implementing a single access platform for heterogeneous and multilingual collections. The network of documents will be constructed by merging and augmenting the information available about each document from each collection, and matching documents and references across the entire combined library. In return for this added value, the rights holders agree to a moving wall policy to secure eventual open access to their full texts. **** Contact information **** BORBINHA JosÃ© Avenida Rovisco Pais 1 1049-001 LISBOA PT Tel. +351 967026783 Fax. +351 218478619";"ICT Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.2.4 - Digital Libraries : Open access to scientific information";" Euro 3.20m";" Euro 1.60m";" 250503";" From 01/02/2010 to 31/01/2013";" Closed";" ICT Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"14";"9"

The core focus of Living Labs is to improve the R&amp;D process by early participation and clustering of end users and business stakeholders, including SMEs. APOLLON will demonstrate the positive impacts of collaborative cross-border Living Lab networking by setting up an advanced pilot composed of 4 thematically focused Living Lab experiments. The Living Lab concept has been widely acknowledged, accepted and used as an effective approach to improve the R&amp;D cycle. It is paramount to ensure that the main strength of local implantation does not also constitute a significant weakness in terms of the general applicability, validity and robustness of Living Lab test results, of providing SMEs with access to other European national markets and of offering the scale needed for pan-European product and service innovation. This brings forward an urgent need for hands-on experiences with intensive networking, cross-comparison and scaling up of local LL initiatives. The exchange of generic, high-level principles and best practices for Living Lab implementation is now being addressed in a number of national and European projects. The next step is to implement a much more detailed analysis of user, market and technology characteristics and an economically more valuable mode of experimentation, by networking, comparing and scaling up cross-border networks of thematically focused, âverticalâ Living Labs in a number of crucial lead markets. The APOLLON approach leverages past experiences and investments to supplement cross-border pilots of best of class methods for setting up, developing and sustainable operation of Living Labs.

The service will enable researchers to formulate their information needs in terms of elements of the scientific methods established in their field (variables, techniques, assessment methods, kinds of objects of interest, etc.) combined with topical descriptions as expressed in metadata. The community approach will enable the enhancement of information seeking with extended evaluation elements (as for example, ratings, public reviews, social tagging and links to supporting or conflicting reports) that complement and go beyond the traditional, anonymous peer review process which results are not made available openly. The technology used will itself become open source, so that the model of the service can be adopted by enterprises (including SMEs) or other kinds of institutions as a value-added, community-oriented model for open access content. **** Contact information **** SICILIA Miguel-Angel Colegio Mayor San Ildefonso - Plaza de San Diego S/N 28801 ALCALA DE HENARES/MADRID SPAIN Tel. +34 91 885 40 00 Fax. +34918854145";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.2.4 - Digital Libraries : Open access to scientific information";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" 250525";" From 01/06/2010 to 31/05/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"14";"10"

"project-250528";"FLAVIUS: Foreign LAnguage Versions of Internet and User generated Sites";"**** Quick and easy multilingual versions of your website **** The web has become the largest place to publish and share all kind of information, from news to user-generated content. The answer to almost any question can be found online, but not necessarily in the working language of each user. Thus, despite of the development of translation tools, language is still a barrier, as most people access information written in their own language only. Very few people in Spain browse UK websites to read users&apos; comments on movies although they often watch the same ones. Similarly very interesting comments on restaurants in Paris are written in German or in English, but not visible to French audience. On the other side, contributors usually write and publish only in their own language. Several options exist today to access information written in another language but all require special settings or skills and are very little used. Some tools also exist for Webmasters to enable the translation of their pages by their visitors, but they do not offer all the necessary features and ease of use: they are not customizable, don&apos;t preserve the site structure, pages are not indexed, and they don&apos;t handle one of the key issues, i.e. the quality of source text which is often not good enough to provide a fluid translation. The FLAVIUS project aims at bridging the language gap between content publishers and users by providing an online platform accessible to websites owners that will enable them to generate multilingual versions of their site, quickly, easily and efficiently in as many languages as they want. The project addresses all the key issues: harmonization of source text to ensure its translatability, preservation of structure and layout of the site, translation customized to the domain of the site. It gathers the most advanced technology providers in the field together with leading European websites representing various types of use (blog platform, community site with comments on restaurants, editorial site on tourism). **** Contact information **** BRUN-FRANC Christophe rue Soyer 5 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine FRANCE Tel. +33 1 41 43 10 36 Fax. +33 1 41 43 10 30";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.5.3 - Multilingual Web : Multilingual Web content management: methods, tools and processes";" Euro 3.70m";" Euro 1.85m";" 250528";" From 01/04/2010 to 30/09/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"7";"5"

The web GIS-based system will incorporate a large number of spatial data services for geo-energy and mineral resources datasets according to OGC specifications. The system will allow users to identify, access, use and reuse in an interoperable and seamless way and for a variety of uses, aggregated geographical information on geo-energy and mineral resources, covering a significant part of Europe (at least ten countries) and coming from a wide range of sources, from local to European level. By developing web services for sharing spatial data between public organizations and authorities (including EC and EU research and policy making institutions) as well as commercial stakeholders, the project will enable the creation of value-added services (such as demand-supply modeling) for the sustainable geo-energy and mineral supply of Europe. The EuroGeoSource system, including the metadata CS- W-compliant metadata catalogue and GIS web application, will enable services for the registration of data sets from different countries, the visualization and overlay of the information layers obtained from distribute sources, spatial and temporal analysis, and so on. The implemented solutions will provide easy and fast access to a large and economically valuable data set for all relevant user groups in the Community. The EuroGeoSource is primarily aimed at the following target user groups: the EC, including the EC Directorate-General for Energy and Transport, EuroStat, the EC JRC Institute for Energy (a member of the project policy and industry advisory board), subsurface users, including oil and gas as well as mining companies, investment companies, geological surveys (including the members of the consortium), research institutes and universities, EU and national geo-energy and mining authorities. **** Contact information **** GRUIJTERS Stephan Princetonlaan 6 3508TA Utrecht THE NETHERLANDS Tel. +31 30 256 48 86 Fax. +31 30 256 46 05";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.6.2 - Public Sector information : Geographic Information";" Euro 2.59m";" Euro 1.30m";" 250532";" From 01/04/2010 to 31/03/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"14";"12"

As announced in the Communication of December 2008 on eAccessibility, the Thematic Network eAccess+ will create a platform for collecting and providing guidance on how to use in practice this body of knowledge. eAccess+ is a best-practice network too that will facilitate co- operation between the community of practitioners (found in research institutions and consultancies) and all the other stakeholders (policy makers, administrators in the public sector, technical staff in the private sector…). The purpose is to accelerate the take-up of e-accessibility specifications and technical solutions, and to contribute to a common approach at European level. The network will support the development of common guidelines and standards, and, where needed, will provide rationale for harmonised political and legal measures. eAccess+ will address the following areas: - web accessibility, as a main focus, in order to ensure accessibility of public web sites in the Member States, in particular through the migration from national web accessibility guidelines and methodologies to the new W3C/WCAG2.0 guidelines, - accessible convergent communications and in particular accessibility of interactive digital television, - self-service terminals, in particular in the banking/financial sector, in public transports, in tourism / cultural heritage, and in e-government. Work will be organised in four methodological steps: consultation (introduction, information, advice, feedback), analysis (problems, ideas, incentives, proposals), support (examples, best practice, guidelines), and dissemination.

This is to be achieved through prolonging the time they can safely remain autonomous and independent at home through monitoring and controlling their social and health status and by providing them with tools and services to support their daily home activities in terms of comfort, security, energy efficiency and communication. The CAALYX-MV system consists in a wearable light device able to measure specific vital signs of the elder, as well as to detect falls and to communicate autonomously in real time with his/her caregiver in case of an emergency, wherever they are. The emergency information can be directed to the personal caretaker and/or to the 112 Emergency Service. The emergency information will provide the geographic position and health information of the elder in a sensible way for the caretaker or emergency service. The incorporation of largely non-intrusive sensors for fall detection and geo- positioning is expected to address many of the concerns of the elderly about adopting technology. The system will be tested and validated in three pilot sites (in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands), and will obtain reliable assessment by gathering real end users' feedback. Finally, the pilots will demonstrate that CAALYX-MV can be easily integrated into the existing technological infrastructure of most European network operators - as well as into up and coming New Generation Networks - and of any home. The system will thus be ready for launch at pan-European level as soon as the project has been successfully validated. **** Contact information **** LÃPEZ DE AYALA HIDALGO Luis Ronda de la ComunicaciÃ³n s/n, Edificio Oeste 1, 4Âª plan 6 28050 MADRID SPAIN Tel. +34 914832642 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2009.1.3 - ICT for health, ageing and inclusion : ICT for ageing well / independent living";" Euro 3.91m";" Euro 1.96m";" 250577";" From 01/02/2011 to 31/01/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"9";"5"

However, an impressive abundance of high quality digital content that is available in Natural History Museums (NHMs) around Europe remains largely unexploited due to a number of barriers. Natural Europe project suggests a coordinated solution at European level in order to overcome such barriers, by connecting the digital collections of a number of European NHMs with Europeana, and studying the educational methods and deploy the necessary software tools that will allow museum educators to design innovative online pathways through the digital collections of NHMs. To this end, the federation of the Natural Europe digital libraries aims to facilitate: storage, search and retrieval of digital content that is related to Natural History; as well as search and retrieval of content objects related to educational objectives and curricula on Natural History, Environmental Education, and Biological Sciences. To achieve this, Natural Europe will design and deploy novel graphical interfaces that will facilitate the navigation of educational pathways within digital collections, both from Europeana and the NHMsâ Web sites. It will also adapt and test innovative interactive installations at the NHMs that will allow visitors to follow educational pathways through Europeanaâs content on Natural History and Sciences, as part of the Museumsâ exhibition.

However in practice this is hard to achieve and the process lacks the active participation of a large number of students and university stakeholders. For this purpose we have conceived MyUniversity, an innovative project that aims at empowering all university members and stakeholders in the higher education decision process, by the means of a transparent and extremely user friendly e-Participation platform. Using this platform together with specialized training on e- Participation and its impact on decision making, participant universities will be able to engage their members and stakeholders on multiple issues to get their feedback, both locally and at European level. This platform is based on the integration and customisation of three existing and mature platforms Demos@Work, Gov2Demos and Pnyx. Two of which have been co-funded by the European Commission. The Consortium has demonstrated experience in the delivery of e-Participation solutions, and a diverse range of skills at its disposal, due to the fact that it is composed of a large IT corporation, an SME, an NGO with wide experience in e-Participation projects, and 17 individual universities (the end-users of MyUniversity) arrayed across 7 different EU member states.

"project-256244";"PARTERRE: Electronic Participation Tools for Spatial Planning and Territorial Development";"Among the lessons learnt from the eParticipation Preparatory Actions a particularly relevant one refers to the long-term sustainability of the undergone trials: permanent adoption of electronic tools for civic participation by public sector organisations is more likely to occur when there is a convincing business model showing financial savings or at least organisational and political advantages in a clear way. A necessary precondition for this business model to âsquareâ is that (offline) participation has to be formally integrated in the legal or regulatory framework the targeted organisation belongs to. This is the case of environmental assessment (at strategic level) and spatial planning (at operational level), provided an EU-wide framework through the ESDP first and now the Territorial Agenda. EU Directives and/or National legislations exist to establish participation as a mandatory requirement for a great deal of policy processes and administrative procedures â mostly involving Regional and City Councils in Europe. With this lesson in mind, the PARTERRE consortium intends to validate the market perspective of a pan-European service based on two electronic tools that have been successfully trialled on previous Preparatory Actions: the Electronic Town Meeting for citizens involvement in agenda setting and the DEMOS-Plan application for stakeholders online consultation in spatial planning. Six pilots in five EU countries will deploy these tools to enhance direct participation of citizens, stakeholders and civil society in the decision-making processes regarding spatial planning and environmental assessment, both at the local and regional level where specific decisions are taken and applied and at the national and EU level where the policy frameworks for Europeâs territorial development are defined. The business goal is to provide a complete âturnkeyâ solution (both technologically and methodologically assessed) to European public authorities. **** Contact information **** MARCOTULLI Angelo Via di Novoli 26 50127 Firenze ITALY Tel. +39-055-4383095 Fax. +39-055-4383195";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" Theme 3 - ICT for government and governance";" Euro 2.33m";" Euro 1.17m";" 256244";" From 01/09/2010 to 31/08/2012";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"8";"5"

Current information, resources and tools may seem too focused on one issue, or be dry and difficult to understand. The resulting sense of detachment from policy making can often lead to wider citizen and community disillusionment with the democratic process itself. This increasing disengagement has been recently highlighted by the low levels of turnout in the 2009 European Elections. Puzzled by Policy aims to end this detachment and disillusionment by providing all citizens â regardless of their literacy skills or subject matter knowledge â a unique platform/portal to learn about policy at the EU level and find out what particular policies mean to them on the national level so they can contribute to policy drafting and impact assessments. Equally important, Puzzled by Policy will help decision makers at both the National and European level better understand the impact of their policies on constituents by feeding citizen reactions back to them. **** Contact information **** SMYTH Maria National University of Ireland, Galway, IDA Business Park, L - .

The Portal will also allow access to repositories of freeware, open source software products and tools for developers of accessibility and assistive solutions, or for mainstream developers who wish to make their products accessible; and will serve as a platform to share expertise, ideas, views, resources and field experience. Such a Portal will initially stem from the existing portal of the European Assistive Technology Information Network (EASTIN); it will take advantage of existing repositories such as the Open Source AT Software (OATSoft), the Open Accessibility Everywhere Group (AOEG) and other Internet resources made available by the partners; it will be maintained in the long term through a collaborative effort of the partners, some of them being committed at national level to be information providers in the field of AT; others being committed as developers of tools and holders of expertise in the area of ICT assistive solutions. Some unique features of the EASTIN engine will be instrumental in ensuring outreach across Europe. These include full multilingualism for all EU languages; the ability to integrate an unlimited number of different information systems, and the flexibility to cope with the temporary unavailability of any such system. This Thematic Network will help 1) make information on available AT and accessibility products and services easily available to the users; 2) connect developers, providers and suppliers of AT solutions from all over Europe; 3) connect developers and professionals (in the health, social services, and educational areas) with end-users of AT, thus injecting the usersâ viewpoint and allowing usersâ feedback; 4) overcome fragmentation in the AT market. **** Contact information **** ANDRICH Renzo via Capecelatro 66 20148 Milano ITALY Tel. +39 02 40308292 Fax. +39 02 4048919";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.3.4 - Assistive technologies and accessibility portal";" Euro 0.69m";" Euro 0.69m";" 270746";" From 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"23";"13"

These are reference objects for all the common and famous species in the world, incl. those of high economic importance and even those that have already gone extinct. Many have great cultural value as they were collected during historic expeditions and scientific endeavours by well known epochal explorers or scientists like Darwin, Linnaeus, Humboldt, or Stanley. EUROPEANA will make these treasures for the first time available to the general public, in addition to providing scientists and policy makers with a substantial information source needed in the understanding and protection of global biodiversity. Although being clearly within the scope of EUROPEANA as part of the scientific and cultural heritage, multimedia objects from the natural history domain are still dramatically underrepresented. This project aims at closing this gap. It will initially make available over 1 M high quality images, movies, animal sound files, and natural history artwork from 23 institutions in 12 European countries. Access will be based on the established technical infrastructure of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Once the pathway from museums and GBIF to Europeana has been created, it will provide a steadily stream of additional objects that have entered the network.

In the run-up to 2014 and in the following years, strong interest in the topic is expected from a wide variety of users â including the general public, local and family historians, education professionals, archives, museums and historical societies, people working in the media, the arts or in the tourism industry. The project consortium will make available to Europeana 425.000 especially relevant items that will be selected with help from specialists and target user groups according to agreed quality criteria. They will span the full range of national library collections including books, newspapers, trench journals, maps, childrenâs literature, posters, pamphlets, propaganda leaflets, medals and coins. The digital collection will go far beyond any existing digital collection on the topic in terms of size, quality and diversity and make Europeana the first stop for quality content on the âGreat Warâ. The consortium will work to enlarge the network and encourage other memory institutions to contribute more relevant content. Europeana 1914-1918 will make a vast amount of sources available online for the first time â content that is often rare and highly fragile because of the deteriorating quality of the paper it was produced on and generally only accessible in reading rooms.

"project-270896";"Open Cities: OPEN INNOVATION Mechanisms in Smart Cities";"The success of cities is linked to their efficiency, in reducing transaction costs and providing services. However, in order to maintain this success, cities have reinvented themselves many times through history. Today, Information Technologies are doomed to be the key driver of a new wave of innovation in cities that will lead, one more time, to their reinvention. However, public procurement and management in cities are not geared to fostering innovation. Therefore, this process of reinvention of transformation of cities into Smart Cities necessarily means to rethink how innovation is managed in cities. Even if Open Innovation is the Â¿de factoÂ¿ standard in innovation management in the private sector, we know little of how to apply it to the public sector and this is even truer when involving technological platforms, especially in aspects such as governance or incentives. This project aims to explore this gap with four main objectives: 1) Distil insights and best practices on how to apply Open Innovation in the Public Sector. 2) Gain understanding on the management of Technological Platforms in an Open Innovation context. 3) Validate the use of pan-European Platforms for Crowdsourcing, Open Data, FTTH networks and Open Sensor Networks. 4) Trigger the development of Advanced Future Internet Services. by leveraging existing tools, trials and platforms in Crowdsourcing, Open Data, Fiber to the Home and Open Sensor Networks in five major European cities: Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona and Helsinki. **** Contact information **** ALMIRALL Esteve AVENIDA PEDRALBES 60-62 08034 BARCELONA SPAIN Tel. +34 609 888 559 Fax. +34 932 048 105";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.4.1 - Open Innovation for future Internet-enabled Services in smart Cities";" Euro 5.80m";" Euro 2.90m";" 270896";" From 01/11/2010 to 30/04/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"15";"5"

The network will identify the actions and the timetable for the Digital Agenda (DAE) and the successful launch of the European Large Scale Action (ELSA), as well as to provide a multi stakeholder planning resource to assist its implementation. The Thematic Network will establish a series of stakeholder groups in sectors as outlined in the ELSA/EIP/DAE report, holding the Key Actions on eID and Authentication. Each of the groups will consider, through further consultations the political, economic, social, technical, legal and environmental aspects of a single European digital community. The 35 partner stakeholders and the initial additional associated partners we present here (who have strongly expressed interest in participating) are only the start of this stakeholdersâ network. The ambition of this network is to build a community of high level European and international experts in the coming 3 years. This community will be built via virtual tools: the dedicated online workspace, online conferences etc as well as via real live events integrated in the EEMA conference agenda and other major European Commission events. The Thematic Network is not intended to be an academic exercise, it is an action plan with a roadmap for the Digital Agenda for the coming decade. As such, the results of the Thematic Network need to reflect a transformational shift in the way everyone in the European community will think, behave, transact and indeed live in the coming years. The vision to be established by the Network can be a beacon to the rest of the world, demonstrating how the efficiency of a digital community can be translated into cultural and economic leadership. **** Contact information **** MERELLA Daniela Via dell'Archiginnasio 00133 Rome ITALY Tel. +39 335 765 1227 Fax. +39 06 2020568";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" Theme 5 - Services f - ICT for improved services for citizens and businesses";" Euro 0.98m";" Euro 0.98m";" 270901";" From 15/11/2010 to 31/10/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"35";"11"

"project-270915";"Bologna: Bologna Translation Service";"There is a continuing and increasing need for educational institutes to provide course syllabi documentation and other educational information in English. Access to translated course syllabi and degree programmes plays a crucial role in the level to which universities effectively attract foreign students and, more importantly, has an impact on international profiling. However, to present all education information in English is a major challenge for most higher education institutes. The figures and trends show that investment in traditional human translation services is prohibitive, consequently course materials and degree programmes are often provided in the local language only. The proposed project aims at providing a solution to this problem by offering a low-cost, web-based, high-quality machine translation (MT) service, the Bologna Translation Service (BTS). The project will make use of experiences and technology from a high-quality MT service currently in use by several Swedish universities and provided by one of the BTS partners. Although there are many existing generic machine translation services none produces good enough quality for the syllabi purpose. The project will cover nine (9) languages (Chinese, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish). We estimate the number of prospective users to be over 1000 universities in the context of our project, and some 2500 in a European context. Further, we assume that major European universities have between 5,000 and 10,000 course syllabi each in need for translation. The Bologna Translation Service will deploy mature technology. Both statistical and rule-based solutions will be applied by the translation engines. Co-operation with on-going European initiatives will be sought. The service will be accessible through a web-interface and accessing the relevant University database where course syllabi and degree programs are produced and edited. **** Contact information **** DEPRAETERE Heidi WOODROW WILSONPLEIN 7 9000 GENT BELGIUM Tel. +32 9 267 64 72 Fax. +32 9 267 64 80";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.6.2 - Multilingual online services";" Euro 3.16m";" Euro 1.58m";" 270915";" From 01/03/2011 to 28/02/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"5";"5"
"project-270917";"LISE: Legal Language Interoperability Services";"The problem addressed by this project is the urgent need of consolidated administrative nomenclatures and legal terminologies as tools to enhance interoperability and cross border collaboration. Without high quality and standards-based terminologies, it is impossible to reach precision, efficiency, and transparency within and across any services, processes and systems in the areas of legal and administrative work. For this project the domain of social security legislation and administration has been selected as a concrete area for which currently there is a high need for such resources but there are no transnational initiatives and no current solutions available to satisfy these needs and to provide a solution. In current manual working environments, high- quality legal terminology work is almost impossible, highly inefficient, and incredibly expensive and thus blocks the full potential of using the resources as a tool for legal support for interoperability. The proposed service that the project establishes is a web-based terminology service platform focusing on consolidated administrative nomenclatures and terminologies as tools to enhance interoperability and cross border collaboration among national institutions cooperating with each other as well as with EU authorities. The project also provides improved accessibility to high quality terminology resources in legal and administrative domains and in different languages and to enable organizations to improve, enhance, and use more efficiently their own terminology repositories at local, regional, national, and trans-national levels. With the user group consortium of the project, we establish and maintain, on the basis of this web-based service infrastructure, a network of European government units, companies, terminology organizations, etc. with the purpose of further developing, harmonizing, and disseminating administrative and legal terminologies and supporting their consistent use in real life situations. **** Contact information **** BUDIN Gerhard GymnasiumstraÃe 50 1190 Vienna AUSTRIA Tel. +431427758020 Fax. +4314277100 99";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.6.2 - Multilingual online services";" Euro 2.50m";" Euro 1.25m";" 270917";" From 01/02/2011 to 31/07/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"5";"4"
"project-270919";"SUMAT: SUMAT: An Online Service for SUbtitling by MAchine Translation";"Subtitling plays a very important role as it is the preferred multimedia content translation method in most of the European countries and for most of the genres, to make audiovisual content widely accessible across languages. The increasing use and transmission of digital multimedia and multilingual content through the web, DVDs and the current European and National policies promoting the subtitling of contents broadcasted by public TVs have had as a consequence that subtitling demands have increased in recent years, being the associated market size very important. However, subtitling and subtitle translation face some important problems that are preventing the expansion of the market and are therefore hindering new business opportunities to arise: Cost, time and quality. There is a clear need to increase the productivity of subtitle translation procedures, reducing costs and turnaround times while enhancing the quality of the translation results. Then, subtitling and audiovisual translation have been recognized as areas that could greatly benefit from the introduction Statistical MT Techniques (SMT) followed by post-editing techniques, in order to increase productivity and enhance the quality of the results. Therefore, SUMAT project will increase the efficiency and productivity of the European subtitle industry, while enhancing the quality of its results, thanks to the effective introduction of SMT technologies in the subtitle translation processes. SUMAT will develop an online subtitle translation service addressing 9 different European languages combined into 14 different language pairs, with the aim to semi-automatize at a large scale the subtitle translation processes of both freelance translators and subtitling companies, in order to optimize their efficiency and productivity thereby helping them to meet the market demands **** Contact information **** DEL POZO ETXEZARRETA Arantza CALLE PASEO MIKELETEGI PARQUE 57 20009 DONOSTIA SAN SEBASTIAN SPAIN Tel. +34943309230 Fax. +34943309393";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.6.2 - Multilingual online services";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" 270919";" From 01/04/2011 to 31/03/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"8";"6"
"project-270926";"Co Cities: Cooperative Cities extend and validate mobility services";"Current EU cooperative systems projects like CVIS, SAFESPOT & COOPERS have demonstrated technical feasibility and positive user acceptance of cooperative mobility services. In the In-Time project common traveller information services based on distributed regional data sources accessible via one commonly agreed data interface have been developed. These common mobility services include dynamic navigation and intermodal routing and advice in real time but deliver no information from the traveller to traffic management. This is the scope of Cooperative Cities, which closes the âfeedback loopâ of cooperative mobility services and hereby elaborates a developement path for traffic management in European cities. Cooperative cities is based on the principle of co-modal transport information services which are coherent with the overall policy strategy and at the same time adaptive to changing dynamic traffic conditions and interactive with travellers. The starting point for cooperative cities technologies is the current status of available mobility information services with high quality data and information and the connection to the mobile users via UMTS/short range media (e.g 802.11p) to the navigator or the smartphone of the user. The cities involved inform the user in a fast, precise and accurate way of the changes in the status of the network and the possible consequences for travel times and connections. Following this approach the cities set up a mobile reference platform for the testing and validation of cooperative traffic information services and combine this with a service evaluation framework for the mobility services. The cities and regions have the possibility to compare their validation experiences with the collected feedback from the user communities of the mobility services. The further communication of best practices between cities is complementary to this work and leads to the definition of a deployment road map for cooperative services in cities. **** Contact information **** FROETSCHER Alexander DONAU CITY STRASSE 1 1220 WIEN AUSTRIA Tel. +431263344464 Fax. +43 1 2633444 10";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.1.3 - Energy efficient co-operative transport management systems";" Euro 3.90m";" Euro 1.95m";" 270926";" From 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"14";"8"

Arrow is a system to facilitate libraries and other users in their diligent search for rightholders in works that are to be included in a digitisation programme of books, through querying a network of European data sources. Arrow Plus plans to extend the number of countries covered, delivering a genuinely pan-European infrastructure, closing the gap in book data quality between European countries. Arrow Plus will also analyse and pilot the extension of Arrow services to the image domain. Interoperability of European book data sources, between countries and between domains - library catalogues, Books in Print (BIP) databases and Reproduction Rights Organisations (RRO) repertoire - is the primary deliverable of the project. Particular attention is paid to the establishment of new book data sources, including BIP and RROs repertoire databases, where these sources do not exist, so to allow a larger number of countries to be covered by the Arrow service. A shared technical infrastructure for the management of BIP and RRO registries, which will also enable the management of a Registry of Orphan Works, will represent one of the core outcomes of the project. The Arrow Plus consortium includes representatives of all relevant stakeholders: libraries, publishers, creators (both writers and visual artists), RROs, photo agencies, and book standards organisations. All are represented at the highest possible level, by the respective European or international organisations in addition to a number of national representatives.

The number of dwellings will be increased when a third cluster enters the project at a later stage. This solution should then benefit the end-user and also the energy distributor who will be able to better manage the facilities provided for the energy and/or water supplies. All along the pilot phase, results will be used to optimise service design. Validation: The different solutions implemented by the three clusters will be assessed and the consortium will identify a set of best practice after a careful evaluation that will take into account real efficiency and adoption on the long run from the end-users. For each solution, technical, social and economical advantages will be identified based on their level of contribution to reach the EnergyTIC project targets and they will be evaluated. This will also be realised through periodic feedback from the other members of the consortium. Each cluster will deploy rapidly the service in their own market and evaluate various other technologies that will complement the end-user experience. This will allow validation and evaluation for European uptake and replication. Dissemination: The project findings and best practice will be disseminated at European scale thanks to the interaction with the Powerhouse project, a project managed by Cecodhas and funded by the intelligent energy programme, in which USH is playing an important role. **** Contact information **** AKIF Youssef Rue Picard 22-32 1080 BRUXELLES BELGIUM Tel. +3225388915 Fax. +3225388916";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" Theme 1 - Low carbon - ICT for a low carbon economy and smart mobility";" Euro 5.28m";" Euro 2.64m";" 270947";" From 01/02/2011 to 31/01/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"15";"4"

This project should prove the attribution that ICT solutions could make to create these circumstances and help create situations for replication that will be attractive and accepted on alarge scale across Europe. To make the results of the project also financially viable we expect to need savings of around 20% in consumption. SHOWE-IT consists of three pilot sites in Rochdale (UK), St Etienne (FR) and Botkyrka (SE) where a total of 211 households will be provided with human-centred, ICT enabled services to save energy and water. We put substantial effort on interaction with the households themselves, motivating them in energy and water saving behaviour. The ICT empowers these households and makes it easy for them to choose more energy/ water efficient behavioural attitudes regarding energy consumption. The technologies are all tested and on the market which guarantees users a durable and full serviced product. With the help of technologies and users education we will be able to control and influence important behavioural patterns of tenants to reduce consumption. The most important elements of savings will come from: â¢ Keeping a comfortable minimum room temperature, reducing temperature when unoccupied, accurate control of the room temperature â¢ Individually heating & hot water billing for each apartment â¢ Optimizing primary heat â¢ Near real- time communication of consumption data â¢ In-home displays will offer inhabitants saving water and optimal use of home appliances â¢ Diagnosis of baseline situation energy and water consumption in selected dwellings identifying consumption levels per household and behaviour of such households. The monitoring stage covers a full year in which all 211 households (plus 120 control group households) are monitored in detail in near real time. This will provide a wealth of evidence on which sound conclusions regarding long term viability can be based. The diagnosing and monitoring is crucial to give evidence of savings and are in such an important element of the project. The project involves leading European companies both from social housing, as from the supply side industry. Also other actors in the value chain (including utilities and SMEâs) are present. The housing associations are represented in national and international peer to peer networks. Through involvement of a Mirror Group of social housing companies that represents 240.000 dwellings across Europe, SHOWE-IT has on forehand created a strong and substantial set of activities directly aiming at large scale replication.

"project-270952";"COSMO: Cooperative Systems for Sustainable Mobility and Energy Efficiency";"Energy efficiency is strictly related to CO2 emissions and by its nature is a global issue. Traffic and transport have the potential of producing savings in energy consumptions that are potentially estimated in 26%. Looking at the traffic and transport system as a whole, energy is addressed in the traffic environment through different angles: â¢ Vehicle fuel consumption: Savings can be achieved by adding different effects: Engine technology; Environment sensitive traffic control strategy; Ecodriving style of the vehicle drivers â¢ Energy used to operate on-road equipment: traffic control management systems need energy to be operated. Signalisation is the component mostly demanding in terms of electrical power. LED technology makes available special features that can be exploited in order to reduce the energy consumption by using the full luminance only when needed. â¢ Energy harvesting: traffic means moving vehicle and ultimately weight in motion. Using the same principle used by electric engines that recover a fraction of this energy to recharge the batteries, also the roadside infrastructure has the possibility to collect a convert into electrical power portion of this energy. The latest technologies and applications for making vehicle and infrastructure dialoguing (cooperative systems) are perfectly fitting in the scenario, and should be exploited since the first phases of deployment. The COSMO project is aiming at addressing all the above mentioned topics by providing practical demonstration on selected test sites. Sites are selected specifically according to their capacity to run a local pilot project, implementing latest technologies to demonstrate the feasibility and level of impact achievable in different operational context and scenario. The result produced are expected to rise the awareness of the decision makers and pave the way for a new generation of energy efficient and environment aware solutions for traffic management and control. **** Contact information **** FRANCO Gino Via Nizza 262/57 10126 Turin ITALY Tel. +39 011 6500411 Fax. +39 011 6500444";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.1.3 - Energy efficient co-operative transport management systems";" Euro 3.88m";" Euro 1.94m";" 270952";" From 01/11/2010 to 30/06/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"12";"5"

This means not only smoother access to information but also the ability to process cross-border cases efficiently. To reach this ambitious goal, a fully technically interoperable European e-Justice system must be designed. The technical solutions envisaged within this context must respect both the principle of independence of the judiciary and of subsidiarity. The e- Services and infrastructure that Member States have already established cover specific requirements of national legal systems. Generally, these national solutions are considerable investments which cannot simply be replaced by new centralized approaches. The objective of the e-CODEX project is neither to re- invent the wheel nor to duplicate one national solution at the European level. Its ambition is to build on these national solutions in order to build a pan- European interoperability layer. Connecting the existing systems will allow communication and data exchange based on the development of common technical standards and foster cross-country cooperation in the area of European e- Justice as well. The following building blocks will be addressed by developing common approaches and standards: - e-Identity-management for natural and legal persons, roles, mandates and rights, user authentication and authorization - e- Signatures, verification and implementation - e-Payment - e-Filing, exchange of documents and data - document standards. Furthermore, intensive communication activities will be set up in order to keep all Member States, legal professions, industry and other stakeholders up to date with regard to the projectâs developments. Finally e-CODEX respects the Council Action Plan on European e-Justice and the communication published by the Commission âTowards a European e Justice Strategyâ and will support the further development of the European e-Justice portal. The project strongly commits to adapt and/or adopt the solutions developed by sibling interoperability projects such as STORK, PEPPOL and SPOCS. The participants of this project are willing to commit to a truly collaborative approach towards achieving a sustainable e-Justice area with fewer practical and technical borders for Europe. **** Contact information **** SCHMIDT Carsten Martin-Luther-Platz 40 40212 DÃ¼sseldorf GERMANY Tel. +49 211 8792 218 Fax. +49 211 8792 474";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.5.2 - ICT for improved services for citizens and businesses";" Euro 14.04m";" Euro 7.02m";" 270968";" From 01/12/2010 to 30/11/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PA Pilot Type A ";"18";"15"
"project-270971";"SMARTiP: Smart Metropolitan Areas Realised Through Innovation & People - SMARTiP";"The idea of the SMARTiP project is to take the experience developed by a wide range of existing user-driven, open innovation initiatives in Europe, particularly those developed through Living Labs, and to apply this experience to the challenge of transforming public services by empowering âsmart citizensâ who are able to use and co-produce innovative Internet-enabled services within emerging âsmartâ cities. The aim is to enable to adoption of open platforms for the co-production of citizen-centric Internet-enabled services in five test-bed sites, Manchester, Gent, Cologne, Bologna and Oulu. The objective is to enhance the ability of the cities to grow and sustain a âsmart cityâ ecosystem which can support new opportunities emerging for a dynamic co-production process resulting in more inclusive, higher quality and efficient public services which can then be made replicable and scalable for cross-border deployment on a larger scale. This will focus on a series of pilot projects, as outlined in section 2.4 âTechnical Pilotsâ, covering three thematic areas: â¢ Smart engagement; â¢ Smart environments; â¢ Smart mobility. The pilots aim to act as a catalyst to stimulate citizen engagement in becoming active generators of content and applications development, as well as being more informed and involved users of the developing Internet-enabled services in âsmartâ cities. âSmart citiesâ require âsmart citizensâ if they are to be truly inclusive, innovative and sustainable. The promise of the information society, to create new ways of empowering people to play a fuller and more equal role in emerging governance systems through their access to dynamic Internet-enabled services, is also proving to be its biggest challenge, as not everyone is getting equal access to the skills and opportunities that are supposed to be there. **** Contact information **** CARTER Dave Portland Street 117-119 M1 6ED Manchester UNITED KINGDOM Tel. +44 161 255 8111 Fax. +44 161 236 2849";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" Theme 4 - Open Futur - Open Innovation for future Internet-enabled Services in smart Cities";" Euro 4.41m";" Euro 2.21m";" 270971";" From 01/11/2010 to 30/04/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"13";"5"

To substantially reduce peak and overall demand for energy and water across EU social housing, BECA will develop a full set of innovative services for resource use awareness and resource management. Balance is achieved by addressing not only energy but water, by including all key energy forms - electricity, gas and heating - and by including strong activities in Eastern Europe as well as in the North, South and West of the EU. Social housing organisations in 7 European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Serbia) and their partners are cooperating in the project to provide ICT-based energy management and energy awareness services directly to social housing tenants and service operators. Services will be piloted by approx. 5,000 social housing tenants across 7 sites in 7 European countries. Sustained reductions in resource use are to be achieved through usable ICT-based services directly to tenants, as well as by effective monitoring and control of local power generation and, for district heating, the full heat delivery chain. Intensive work will be addressed to optimising services for tenants and maximising impact on resource use behaviour. Service requirements will be investigated with tenants and staff and service prototypes based on initial use cases will be subject to user testing within the first year of the project. Results are used to finalise service design in a second iteration of use case definition and service specification lasting some 8 months, cumulating in implementation of operational services at all the 7 pilot sites. Pilots at sites will operate for at least 14 months; lead sites will be identified to being operation early and provide example solutions to others. The consortium, led by social housing providers and public authorities includes global ICT and service providers and distribution network operators working with local consultants and specialist advisors to carry out all steps in service implementation. **** Contact information **** ROBINSON Simon OXFORDSTRASSE 2 53111 BONN GERMANY Tel. +49228985300 Fax. +492289853012";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" Theme 1 - Low carbon - ICT for a low carbon economy and smart mobility";" Euro 5.55m";" Euro 2.70m";" 270981";" From 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"18";"8"

"project-270988";"ATIS4all: Assistive Technologies and Inclusive Solutions for All";"Disability as a human rights issue and matter of law was confirmed in the UNCRPD adopted by the General Assembly at its sixty-first session in December 2006. The Convention is the first human rights treaty that the EC as a whole has ratified. It aims to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy human rights on an equal basis with other people. People with special needs in Europe continue to be confronted with a number of barriers to usage of everyday ICT products and services. Inclusive ICT and Assistive Technologies (ATs) are essential for enabling full participation in society for many people, notably people with disabilities and elderly people. These technologies allow people to participate more fully in the knowledge society by mitigating barriers many face in their daily life environments. ATIS4all proposes an innovative approach without discarding the achievements of the traditional methods. It is based on three cornerstones: - Usage of Web 2.0 technologies and user participation. Participation of relevant actors of the AT ICT field in vertical social networks enriches contents and fosters market dynamism, - Redefinition of the target market. The potential beneficiaries of ATs and accessibility devices and services are not only people with strictly defined disabilities. - Focus on open software and cutting-edge technological trends. Assistive Technologies and Inclusive Solutions as solutions for anyone, at any time and anywhere. Supported by the cornerstones mentioned above, ATIS4all will start up and maintain: an open, collaborative portal offering information on AT ICT and accessibility products and services available across Europe; a repository of open source assistive technology software and cutting-edge technological trends; and a network of partners that will provide their knowledge and expertise to manage, control, foster and dynamise the participation of the key actors in the portal and repository. **** Contact information **** MARTÃNEZ USERO JosÃ© Ãngel C/ Albasanz 16 3-B1 28037 Madrid SPAIN Tel. +34 91 141 38 21 Fax. +34 91 375 70 51";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" Theme 3 - ICT for he - ICT for health and inclusion";" Euro 0.59m";" Euro 0.59m";" 270988";" From 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"19";"10"

However, even where language resources and respective tools are available they have been developed mostly in a sporadic manner, in response to specific project needs, with relatively little regard to their long-term sustainability, IPR status, interoperability, reusability in different contexts as well as to their potential deployment in multilingual applications.The CESAR project, in close harmony with META-NET intends to address this issue by enhancing, upgrading, standardising and cross- linking a wide variety of language resources and tools and making them available, thus contributing to an open linguistic infrastructure.Partners in the CESAR consortium are key players in their respective language community with a proven track record in European language technology projects including infrastructure initiatives, such as TELRI in the past and notably CLARIN at present.The project will make available a comprehensive set of language resources and tools covering the Hungarian, Polish, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian and Slovak languages. Resources will include interoperable mono and multilingual speech databases, corpora, dictionaries and wordnets and relevant language technology processing tools such as tokenisers, lemmatisers, taggers and parsers. A comprehensive initial list of tools and resources identified as potential targets of project activity can be found in Section 3.2. Depending on local capacities and efficiency considerations, the resources may be either made available as web services at partners' site or contributed to the META_SHARE digital exchange facility.In addition to the technical work required, great effort will be made to ensure sustainability through mobilising the LT community, raising awareness of the fundamental role of language resources among the R&amp;D policy makers, the media and the general public. **** Contact information **** VÃRADI TamÃ¡s Benzcur utca 33 1068 BUDAPEST HUNGARY Tel. +36 1 3214830 126 Fax. +36 1 322 9297";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2010.6.1 - Open linguistic infrastructure";" Euro 4.16m";" Euro 2.08m";" 271022";" From 01/02/2011 to 31/01/2013";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"9";"6"

This will be enabled by designing and implementing citizen-driven open innovation methodologies and processes. For these purposes, during PEOPLE project, four pilot Smart Open Innovation Urban Ecosystems will be created to become seeds towards sustainable smart cities for the people to live better at. We will call them PEOPLE Pilots, and they will be heavily networked in order to enhance the total impact by creating synergies and increasing knowledge generation and uptake. Four pilots will be created during the project, at four different European cities: 1) Bilbao, in Spain; 2) Vitry sur Seine, in France, belonging to the Isle de France area, close to Paris; 3) Thermi, in Greece and 4) Bremen, in Germany. 8 Open Innovation loops will be run during the project on a 3-month basis, starting from the very beginning in order to incorporate users from early stages, while fully defining the scenarios and needs to tackle and services to deploy (including definition of functional and non-functional requirements). These loops will also be important for testing and validating all project results, as well as services from other projects being tested within PEOPLE Pilots. The final aim is to end the project with a portfolio of ICT services really deployed at each Pilot: 1) Resulting from/giving answer to the actual interests and needs of the different stakeholders in the Pilot; 2) Although they could be deployed as prototypes at the end of the project, they would have been completely tested and validated by users, also considering the businesses models needed for their final time-to- market and future exploitation. **** Contact information **** ORTIZ MONTALBAN Maria Eugenia Avda.

"project-297191";"Commons4EU: Commons for Europe";"Cities face a scenario characterized by shrinking budgets, increasing demands of services from their citizens and the need to reinvent themselves in their quest to become Smart Cities. Simultaneously, the Internet brought new opportunities to orchestrate collaboration, fostering the creation of a large base of commons in code, user generated contents and even telecom infrastructures with the emergence of Bottom-up-Broadband networks. Cities have many times lacked the resources and mechanisms to take full advantage of this wealth. However, organizations like Code for America are showing how they can effectively and successfully intermediate between citizens and cities and help in closing this gap. Commons4EU aims to build on the shoulders of this experience with an initial core team of 7 cities: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Helsinki, Manchester, Rome and UK-NESTA (UK cities involved in the project through NESTA) working together in 2 main areas: 1) Code Commons. Developing collaborative web projects following the methodology of Code for America based on principles rather than on sectors and by opening existing code in the participating cities and leveraging the European EPSI platform, following a certain model. They should: - Be web/mobile applications. - Enable cities to connect with their constituencies in ways that reduce administrative cost and engage citizens more effectively. - Support the move toward transparency and collaboration. -Be shareable, meaning that an application built for one city could be used by any other city. 2) Bottom-up-Broadband Commons. Exploring with users in real-life environments, three new technologies: Super Wifi, Sensor integration into wifi networks and fiber deployment as commons (both new techniques such as aerial as well as fiber bandwidth management) The experience of the project will be capitalized giving birth to two pan European organizations: Code for Europe and BuB for Europe that will carry further on its endeavour. **** Contact information **** CASTELLUCCI Laura Av.

"project-297192";"SEED: Speeding “Every European Digital”";"The target of SEED is to expand, through the âcloud computingâ approach and a very cheap network of Interactive Public Service Advertising (i-PSA) nodes, the positive results of European Inclusive e-Governance initiatives to boost âcitizen-centricâ e-Gov Services, to reuse as much as possible the European, National, Regional and Local stocks of Public Sector Information (PSI) and to leverage saving costs of e-Government and e-Governance deployments. SEED re-uses PSI making mash-ups of e-Gov contents for raising awareness of citizens about e-Gov services available across all Europe: it is, transforming PSI in i-PSA messages. For speeding âcitizen-centricâ e- services, it is not enough to transform previous ânon-inclusive e-Govâ into âinclusive e-Govâ services, if many citizens are still not aware that this new friendly way of providing public services are ready for them. An intermediate link âfor raising awarenessâ among citizens is still missing in this chain of service provision. The main aim of SEED is to properly tackle European citizens for raising the awareness of useful e-Gov contents and services previously invested by European Public Sectors, mainly, mixing cross- border services of European, National, Regional and Local level. Both citizens and businesses must be aware and able to benefit from inclusive e-Gov services everywhere in Europe regardless of their country of origin. However, in the present context of economic crisis and Public Sector budgetary constraints, it is extremely important to show that SEED outcomes, deployed across âcloud computingâ approaches, can be reached in a highly ambitious affordable way, with clear quantitative indicators, assuring the best value for money (savings higher than 20%) using SEED against conventional alternative e-Gov service deployments of Public Service Advertising (PSA). **** Contact information **** ALBORG MIGUEL PARQUE TECNOLOGICO CALLE BENJAMIN FRANKLIN 27 46980 PATERNA VALENCIA SPAIN Tel. +34 96 112 40 00 Fax. +34 96 112 40 54";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.4.1 - Towards a cloud of public services";" Euro 5.13m";" Euro 2.56m";" 297192";" From 01/01/2012 to 30/06/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"13";"8"

Public fascination with the architectural and archaeological heritage is well known, it is proven to be one of the main reasons for tourism according to the UN World Tourism Organisation. Historic buildings and archaeological monuments form a significant component Europeâs cultural heritage, they are the physical testimonies of European history and of the different events that led to the creation of the European landscape, as we know it today. The project will exploit existing tools and methods, to integrate them in a complete supply chain of 3D digitization to contribute a significant mass of 3D content to Europeana. The project will focus on UNESCO World Heritage monuments and other monuments of outstanding value at European level, to illustrate a particular strand of Europeâs history. The digital content will include overall 3D models and reconstructions, enlarged models of important details, images, texts, videos. It will also include and re-contextualize in 3D, objects belonging to a monument but presently located elsewhere, for example in a museum. The projectâs activities will include both new digitization as well as the conversion of some existing 3D data into formats which are accessible for Europeana users. The projectâs anticipated impact is making accessible through Europeana an unprecedented quantity of high-quality, 3D, well-organized and attractive information about the masterpieces of European architecture and archaeology. **** Contact information **** NICCOLUCCI Franco Via Chiatamone 61/61 80121 naples ITALY Tel. +39081293501 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.2.2 - Digitising content for Europeana";" Euro 5.30m";" Euro 2.65m";" 297194";" From 01/02/2012 to 31/01/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"16";"9"
"project-297206";"SUSTAINS: Support USers To Access INformation and Services";"SUSTAINS comprises a rich basket of services based on giving citizens online access to their Electronic Health Records (EHR). The services proposed have been distilled from the experience of regions which have already pioneered such access. The SUSTAINS Consortium is composed of regions in the EU leading in the area of innovation in services for citizens, and a number of user and professional associations all equally committed to the implementation of key action 13 of the Digital Agenda for Europe. Consortium Partners have already demonstrated this commitment by creating a Group of Interest with such a goal as its main mission. Regions will share their experiences and achievements to speed up the implementation of the SUSTAINS basket of services in a representative cross-section of EU regions. Patient empowerment is high on the agenda of the Consortium, together with great care in addressing the concerns of the professionals in what could be seen as a revolution in the patient- healthcare professional relationship. Legal and ethical issues associated with online access by citizens to their EHR will be thoroughly explored, and lessons will be drawn from 11 pilots in 9 EU countries and disseminated to facilitate the implementation of similar services by other regions. Meaningful and measurable indicators have been selected to assess the impact and satisfaction with the services by citizens/patients and professionals. SUSTAINS contributes to 3 major healthcareÂ¿related issues in modern society: 1. Empowerment of patients: There is a growing tendency by patients and the public to question information from the health system, ask for a second opinion, demand respect and dignity in their treatment, expect convenience, etc. 2. Quality of care: New progress in healthcare means that patients demand, and healthcare professionals want to offer, the best quality of care. 3. Efficiency and economy: There is a growing demand from patients/citizens for improved efficiency and economy. **** Contact information **** EKLUND Benny SLOTTSGRAND 2A 751 25 UPPSALA SWEDEN Tel. +46705101306 Fax. +46 18 611 60 10";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.3.4 - Empowering patients and supporting widespread deployment of telemedicine services";" Euro 6.99m";" Euro 3.50m";" 297206";" From 01/01/2012 to 31/12/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"16";"11"
"project-297210";"OASIS: Openly Accessible Services and Interacting Society";"In many regions of Europe, citizens and businesses are faced with the difficulty or impossibility of finding information and services provided by local public authorities on the internet. Any such information currently available is often segmented and isolated in a non-user friendly manner. The current project will facilitate access to information, public services and economic promotion by grouping online services in a unified portal following a user-centered logic . Federating services in a unique environment will enable public administrations to make better use of customer and businesses information and adapt public services (e-services) so they more often meet the needs of people and businesses. The result will be services that are more accessible, more user-friendly, more efficiently run by public authorities and less expensive for the taxpayer. The OASIS project will take advantage of open platforms and open standards using a cloud architecture. The Internet provides a reliable and trusted base for building applications and services. Cloud computing offers highly scalable databases for applications achieving great performances. Distributed data centers also provide fault tolerance against disasters, therefore improving the robustness of communications. Cloud distribution offer ubiquitous network access, location independent resources and rapid elasticity. The pilot will focus specifically on 12 applications for citizens, public authorities and businesses. The pilot will include user- enriched content from citizens/residents and will be accessible via internet, and smart phones with a telephone hotline and training sessions for support. The Pilot B of shared services will be demonstrated in 5 sites during 12 months. **** Contact information **** HOUZET Sophie Le Rhovalparc - avenue de la Gare - EntrÃ©e B - Alixan 1 26958 Valence FRANCE Tel. +33 4 75 83 50 58 Fax. +33475829631";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.4.1 - Towards a cloud of public services";" Euro 3.81m";" Euro 1.91m";" 297210";" From 01/02/2012 to 31/01/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"13";"6"
"project-297220";"CitySDK: Smart City Service Development Kit and its Application Pilots";"We will produce three large-scale pan-European smart city service pilots in the eight partner cities. The pilots are in the domains of smart mobility, smart participation and smart tourism. A combination of city organisationsâ leadership, collaboration between the cities, and a large amount of partnersâ relevant existing services, interfaces, software, practices and standards in these domains are the key enabler for this broad approach. For effectiveness within the project, but even more so for the impact beyond the project pilots, we will package selected prior assets and the project pilot deliverables into a shared, uniform, open source City Service Development Kit â CitySDK. CitySDK is aimed for further developers to use, either in the partner cities or in new cities. With this we wish to enhance the development and innovation capability and between-city transfer possibilities of European Smart City Applications. During the project we will engage a vast number of citizens and developers to further exploit the CitySDK. As the pilots are run by the cities and their domains are much in the daily lives of the citizens, the project foresees to reach a total coverage of 31 million people, with up to 0,5 million active real people-users, engage up to 1.000 new developer SMEs in 8 countries, and build a self-sustaining, thriving smart city application ecosystem that lives well beyond the project funding. The consortium aims to contribute substantially to the creation of a single European market for technologically convergent smart city applications, in order to reduce the European internal single market gap against North America and the ubiquitous computing technology gap against some Asian countries. **** Contact information **** MATTILA Marja Aleksanterinkatu 16-18 00170 Helsinki FINLAND Tel. +358407440067 Fax. +358103872719";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.5.1 - Open Innovation for future Internetenabled Services in smart Cities";" Euro 6.84m";" Euro 3.42m";" 297220";" From 01/01/2012 to 30/06/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"23";"9"

The scope of the ICT services is the integration of different management systems operating on the existing EV infrastructures in the cities where the pilots will be run, so that related services are deployed making use of these interconnected infrastructures. The pilots will be based in a growing, geographically speaking, scope. There will be three main pilots. The first one will be based in Bristol, UK, and its commute area. The second one will join the Spanish towns of Vitoria and Pamplona, creating a common corridor of 100 Km length. And finally the Slovenian pilot within the main cities of the country, Ljubljana and Maribor, that will be combining the union of two cities plus an international scope, as this pilot will count with the observers from the region of Styria in Austria, which have shown a big interest in the proposal. The consortium is comprised of the adequate profiles in all pilots as public administration, technology experts and energy managers have been involved. Target users will be electric vehicle drivers, public and privately owned fleets and public transport systems. The pilot will support the interaction among different kind of vehicles: cars and vans, motorbikes, bicycles, pedestrians and public transport system EVs, etc. Among the technologies used in the project there will be different types of charging points, the integration of management systems for them, different kinds of EVs, devices for the users, etc. The project will also deal with the creation of a cooperation network among the cities in the pilots to foster collaboration in smart electromobility topics.

"project-297225";"I-DONT-FALL: Integrated prevention and Detection sOlutioNs Tailored to the population and Risk Factors associated with FALLs";"Falls are the most prominent among the external causes of unintentional injury, since they account for approximately 40% of all injury deaths. Fall rates (and related mortality rates) vary depending on the country and the studied population. At the same time, falls are also associated with various risk factors, spanning the areas of biological, behavioral, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. In addition to this broad categorization, studies show that falls are commonly a result of the elderly/patients conditions and status including for example conditions associated with balance / gait, cardiovascular, medication, feet / footwear, vision, medical, depression, as well as other risk factors. In the recent years, ICT technologies have manifested their potential to enhance the autonomy and quality of life of elderly people, through boosting detection and/or prevention of elderly falls. Likewise, ICT solutions for fall detection and prevention could significantly reduce the cost associated with elderly care. \n\n The value and effectiveness of these solutions could be maximized on the basis of their further integration and combination, but mainly on their tailoring to specific target groups and risk factors. This tailoring could allow potential fallers to use the most appropriate devices, modalities and program (e.g. in terms of proper frequencies/combinations for using certain devices). I-DONT- FALL project tackles this problem by testing integrated and fall management solutions, while allowing the tailoring of fall technological solutions to the specific needs, root causes, risk factors and cultural factors associated with fall incidents. \n\n \n\n The main goal of the I-DONT-FALL project is to deploy, pilot and evaluate a range of innovative ICT solutions for fall detection and prevention management. The platform will be flexibly configured to the needs of specific target groups and risk factors associated with fall incidents. Based on the I-DONT-FALL integrated platform: (a) End-users will enjoy tailored fall technological solutions, while (b) Medical experts and health professionals will be offered a wide range of tools, enabling them to customize fall solutions to the end- users&rsquo; needs. The effectiveness of the solutions will be tested by over 500 elderly users/ patients across different countries, cultures, age groups and fall risk factors. From a policy perspective, the project will elicit best practices for tailoring fall management solutions to specific risk factors, root causes and users&rsquo; (fallers&rsquo;) needs. \n\n In particular, the I-DONT-FALL project will contribute to: 1. Substantially prolonging the time that elderly people can live independently at home by providing ICT-based safety and fall prevention/detection services; 2. Delivering evidence of improvements in the quality of life of older people and their families, as well as for health and social care systems and services; 3. Facilitating wide take-up of ICT based fall prevention solutions across Europe; 4.

"project-297250";"Daguerreobase: Daguerreobase";"The daguerreotype was the first successful photographic process in the history of photography and can be seen as the âIncunabula of Photographyâ. On January 7, 1839, the daguerreotype was presented at the AcadÃ©mie des Sciences in Paris. The daguerreotype is named after its inventor Louis-Jacques-MandÃ© Daguerre, was widely used in Europe and represents the first photographic images of Europe and its citizens. The base of the daguerreotype is a highly polished metal plate, consisting of a thin layer of silver on a copper support. A daguerreotype is created through direct exposure in the camera and delivers a unique image from which no further prints can be made. There are still many aspects of the daguerreotype that need to be discovered to understand the impact of photography on Europeâs social and cultural history. In order to do so all information on the surviving daguerreotypes needs to be collected, thus making identifying, attributing and gathering further knowledge on the remaining examples of this earliest form of photography possible. A first attempt was made by the Dutch initiative www.daguerreobase.org. This initiative covered only The Netherlands. Daguerreobase can however only function as an efficient cultural and informative tool for Europeana and its users when more daguerreotypes from a large number of European collections will be brought together. This is exactly the aim of the current Daguerreobase project proposal: to develop a common reflection and best practice in the collection and dissemination of information on daguerreotypes in European collections, thus creating a knowledge base designed by and for all of those interested in Europeâs divers cultural heritage. Through a European-wide consortium and supported by workshops we want to enhance the functionality of the knowledge base, compile and aggregate existing digital content held by different cultural institutions from across Europe and make it accessible through Europeana. **** Contact information **** DECKERS Ann FotoMuseum Provincie AntwerpenWaalsekaai 47 2000 Antwerpen BELGIUM Tel. +32 3 2429313 Fax. +32 3 2429310";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.2.1 - Aggregating content in Europeana";" Euro 1.87m";" Euro 1.50m";" 297250";" From 01/11/2012 to 30/04/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"18";"13"
"project-297251";"SMART CAMPUS: SMART CAMPUS - Building-User Learning Interaction for Energy Efficiency";"This project aims at the development of services and applications supported by a data gathering platform that integrates real time information systems and intelligent energy management systems that drive a bi-directional learning process such that the user learns how to interact with the building and the building learns how to interact with the user in a more energy efficient way. SMART CAMPUS targets Public buildings (Universities) through the use of Services enabled by ICT in particular by supporting the user behaviour transformation through the interaction between the user and the buildingâs intelligent energy management system. Furthermore the eco-conscious educated user will be empowered with real time ubiquitous information and decision making guidance that will enable and motivate the interaction leading to Energy Efficiency. SMART CAMPUS expects an impact of substantial Energy Savings up to 20% of total saving, being up to 15% the result of consumer behaviour transformation. The users will be addressed at 4 public Universities located at Helsinki, Lulea, Lisbon and Milan. The service will be used to educate, influence and transform the user energy consumption behaviour sustaining these behavioural changes by his/her empowerment with real time interactive information (simulation) and guided/influenced decision making (usage profile modelling and negotiation). The services and applications provided will be based on a reference of best practices in terms of energy usage but will also take into account the user preferences, balancing the pre-set definitions with the user preferences, having therefore a bidirectional learning process between the building and the users. The project progress and results will be pro- actively disseminated trough Web 2.0 tools, namely the SMART CAMPUS Portal, and with brochures, newsletters and videos, aiming at reaching a wide audience. **** Contact information **** CASTRO SÃ³nia Alameda da Guia 192A 2750-368 CASCAIS PORTUGAL Tel. +351214866784 Fax. +351214866752";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.1.2 - ICT for Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings";" Euro 4.68m";" Euro 2.34m";" 297251";" From 01/08/2012 to 31/01/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"9";"4"
"project-297260";"PALANTE: PAtient Leading and mANaging their healThcare through EHealth";"Patient empowerment is considered a potential tool to reduce healthcare costs and improve efficiency of the health systems, reinforcing healthcare quality. Patient empowerment has become an element of high priority in the EU health strategy, supported by national and regional health authorities. Building on already existing e-health platforms and services in the participating regions, the PALANTE project focuses on the implementation, scaling up and optimisation of 7 demonstration pilots based on the concept of secure and user friendly online access by citizens to their medical/health data. The main goal of this proposal is to empower patients so they will be able to make informed decisions about their health, take an active role in their care and collaborate effectively with their healthcare team thanks to the use of information and communication technologies. The PALANTE Project considers 7 new pilots in 6 countries (7 regions) and 2 additional on-going pilots in 2 other countries. The pilots have been carefully selected to cover different levels of patient empowerment. Globally, the project mobilizes 21 partners in 10 different countries, and 69.550 new users. Pilot teams include public and private partnerships ensuring all the key stakeholders involved in eHealth provision. All the pilots address the issue of patientâs secure access to their own health information. Additionally, 5 of these pilots deal with integrated chronic disease management support, including comprehensive self-learning, education and monitoring systems that will be validated for diabetes, chronic heart failure, severe arthritis and respiratory diseases. They cover a wide range of services with different grade of complexity and thus different number of patients according to each service. The Project also takes into account the challenge of patientsâ mobility by addressing interoperability among pilots. Some partners of PALANTE consortium are directly involved in EpSOS project. **** Contact information **** NIETO Virginia Avda.

"project-297268";"DISCOVER: Digital Inclusion Skills for Carers bringing Opportunities, Value and Excellence";"**** DISCOVER - Digital Inclusion Skills for Carers **** [EU]  DISCOVER aims to tackle 3 main issues: increased digital competences and engagement of social inclusion actors (carers); increased use of ICT solutions for delivering social support and care; and raising the profile of social inclusion work. The project will create a new service to deliver digital skills training for carers. This will focus in particular on opportunities for informal carers as a socially excluded group. DISCOVER is based on existing eLearning systems in Birmingham (Birmingham City University, The Open University) and Thessaloniki (Aristotle University Thessaloniki). The DISCOVER platform will integrate the existing systems and provide access to rich digital skills learning experiences. Participants will use a variety of channels including computer, mobile phones and digital television. The project will also maximise value through repurposing and improving existing content. The DISCOVER platform will become the single point of entry for carers. DISCOVER will be piloted in 4 testbeds in Thessaloniki, several locations across the Netherlands, Zamora and Valladolid and Birmingham. 400 informal and formal carers will be given digital skills training. Carers will learn to become mentors for their peers and for the older people they care for, thus increasing the initial reach of the project. DISCOVER will enable carers to start on a learning pathway into wider education. Expected benefits are improved digital skills, better communication and support for carers i.e. less isolation through virtual and real social networks, increased confidence and thus a better quality of life. Indirectly a changed attitude towards using ICT for care delivery is anticipated which longterm supports more efficient care services. The âlearn to learnâ approach will support personal development ultimately supporting employability. The benefits for the older people will lie in an improved quality of care, greater skills and self-reliance all supporting a better quality of life. **** Contact information **** SCHUSTER-JAMES Heike 1 Lancaster Circus PO Box 161 B4 7DG Birmingham UNITED KINGDOM Tel. +441216758887 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.3.2 - Digital competences and social inclusion";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" 297268";" From 01/04/2012 to 31/03/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"9";"5"

It is built upon the Portuguese, the Irish, the city of Amsterdam (The Netherlands), and the Galician (Spain) ongoing electro-mobility initiatives. Involving all the relevant stakeholders, it will be capable of delivering comprehensive and innovative solutions to foster electro-mobility among European citizens. The Project aims to integrate these four initiatives, generating additional mobility services in benefit of the EV user. Its main features are: i) make the user more comfortable to use EV beyond the limits of ârange anxietyâ by providing EV users with universal access to an interoperable charging infrastructure independent from its energy utility and region; ii) promote energy-efficient mobility services through a seamless integration with the transport system and with the EV ecosystem; iii) contribute to the standardization and openness of the EV ecosystem through a System of Systems (SoS) approach establishing open interfaces between the different systems and stakeholders; and iv) establish the management interface between the EV infrastructure and the electric grid, taking benefit of this information to create a more reliable and efficient end-to-end energy system. MOBI.Europe will enable also the assessment of energy sources and the tracking of each user carbon footprint, opening the door to the integration of a new credit model based on CO2 emissions, thus setting a benchmark for rewarding consumers. Specific action plans for each country, together with the maturity of the technical solution and the accumulated experience and compromise of MOBI.Europe partners are the key elements to assure future scalability and long term deployment. **** Contact information **** CAETANO JoÃ£o NULL NULL NULL NULL PORTUGAL Tel. +35 1967201235 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.1.3 - Smart Connected Electro-Mobility";" Euro 5.12m";" Euro 2.40m";" 297271";" From 01/01/2012 to 31/12/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"12";"5"
"project-297273";"SMARTSPACES: Saving Energy in Europe's Public Buildings Using ICT";"To substantially reduce peak and overall demand for energy and water across EU public buildings, the project will develop a service comprising innovative ICT- based energy decision support, awareness and management service components. Decision support is provided directly to city energy managers and other professionals responsible for building performance, and to building users, both staff and visitors to the building, including school pupils and university students and the general public, enabling all to optimise their energy-related behaviour based on up-to-date meter feedback on energy consumption. Management components of the service include effective ICT control of local renewable power and the full heat delivery chain for district / building systems. The SMARTSPACES service will enable public authorities in Europe significantly to improve their management of energy in the buildings they occupy. In operational terms, the consortium will carry out intensive work on optimising services for all user groups and maximising impact on resource use behaviour. Within the first year, requirements will be investigated with users, use cases agreed and service prototypes subject to rigorous user testing. Test results help finalise service components in a second design iteration lasting some 8 months, cumulating in implementation of operational services at all 11 pilot sites with more than 550 buildings in 8 countries (UK, FR, DE, IT, ES, NL, TR, RS) with almost 20,000 professionals and staff users and reaching an estimated more than 6,000,000 visitors annually. Pilots at all sites will operate for at least one year; lead sites will be identified to being in operation early and provide example solutions to others.

"project-297274";"DM2E: Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana";"The projects aims to technically enable as many content providers as possible to integrate their content into Europeana. Since different providers make their data available in different formats, a tool has to be developed that converts metadata from a diverse range of source formats into the EDM (Europeana Data Model). During the project, this will exemplarily be done for the autograph database Kalliope (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin), the German text archive Deutsches Textarchiv (Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften), as well as content of the Austrian national library (Ãsterreichische Nationalbibliothek) plus a number of other sources. Metadata providers are strongly encouraged to make their data available under CC0, as all other licenses hamper further use by Europeana and scholars. Finally, Europeana is going to provide the aggregated data in a form which allows Digital Humanities scholars to make best use of them. In addition, basic services / functionalities (modeled on the humanities' âscholarly primitivesâ) will be provided by Europeana. In this perspective, the proposed project is in line with theme 2 of the call (Digital Content) and targets its objective 2.1 (Aggregating content in Europeana).

The ICT concept proposed with this action will be based on the off-the-shelf âFar Echoâ ICT system, developed by the partner FAR Systems for the targeted countries Italy, Slovenia and Greece. The âFar Echoâ ICT system has already been installed and successfully tested for more than one year in Italy. The âFar Echoâ ICT system will be implemented in each pilot building according to the building characteristics and National standards. In order to do this, a preliminary analysis of every individual pilot case has been already made during the proposal preparation phase in order to have a realistic view of the proposed solutions. A further and more accurate energetic analysis will be carried out at the beginning of the project and a strategy will be developed to achieve the foreseen reduction in the energy consumption. The analysis is based on a classification for each pilot of the main loads and energy supply systems, considering their efficiency, timely profile, and the capacity of the current control (if available) to be improved by the installation of the proposed concept based on the âFar Echoâ ICT system. The analysis will refer to energy as well as to the behavior of the people.

"project-297290";"GREEN@Hospital: web-based enerGy management system foR the optimization of the EnErgy coNsumption in Hospitals";"Hospitals are known to be large energy consumers and in most European countries the high proportion of ageing building stocks makes hospitals amongst the least energy efficient public buildings. Nowadays there is a growing urgency to achieve real energy savings from existing building stocks and to build more sustainable new hospitals. The GREEN@Hospital project aims at integrating the latest ICT solutions in order to obtain a significant energy saving in existing hospital buildings, through a better management of energy resources and losses reduction. This will be carried out by the realization of Web-based Energy Management and Control Systems â Web-EMCS â which integrates monitors and controls multiple buildings systems at the component level. Moreover models to assess the energy savings will be developed and algorithms for consumption optimisation implemented. The proposed solution will be also supported by a Maintenance Energy Service, specifically developed and integrated in the Web- EMCS to maintain optimal energy efficiency after initial efforts. Four different hospitals have been selected across Europe to take part in the pilot in order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed solution under real operating conditions. Each hospital will make available specific areas selected considering the presence of: 1) renewable energy sources, 2) already available building management systems that can be easily integrated in the Web-EMCS, 3) refurbishing plans aiming at energy efficiency improvement. Moreover, they will contribute by providing different functional areas so that the consumption needs of a typical hospital structure will be globally included in the technical solution. An intense dissemination activity will be planned to spread the project outcomes across Europe. The study will be the basis for possible replications of the solutions taking into account savings and return of investments. **** Contact information **** PACI Riccardo Via Fiume 16 60030 Angeli di Rosora (AN) ITALY Tel. +39 0731 816 219 Fax. +39 0731 81 47 00";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.1.2 - ICT for Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings";" Euro 2.87m";" Euro 1.43m";" 297290";" From 01/03/2012 to 28/02/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"11";"4"

Video-to-video can be used to save patients lives, improve city administration, reduce fuel costs, reduce carbon footprint, enhance education and improve city experiences for tourists and cultural consumers. We build a wireline and 4G wireless network of cities and include a right of way without interference from unwanted traffic so that each user in any of the cities can experience live interactive high definition video-to-video. LiveCity is a technology integration trial which offers advanced services to over 3000 users in five European Cities. This unifying approach in five cities underpins a use case framework and technology platform which can be rolled out to other cities and communities on a mass market basis following the life of the project. We propose to pilot a number of video-to- video services in five cities for a diverse range of applications in the areas of Emergency Services, eHealth, Education and City Experiences. The cities involved are Dublin, Luxembourg, Athens, Tubingen and Valladolid. LiveCity will pilot these live high quality video-to-video applications in order to evaluate social utility and demonstrate value to city citizens. Stakeholder evaluation and key performance indicators will be measured, analysed and disseminated. The LiveCity hypothesis is that these indicators can be enhanced with video-to- video. For example in the emergency services use case important indicator are time to delivery of clot busting drugs and patient survival rate. In the diabetes case, indicators include blood glucose level and quality of life measures. Other indicators will be collected and evaluated for the different pilots. We build a business case for the rollout of the services to all the major cities in Europe. **** Contact information **** CHOCHLIOUROS Ioannis Kifissias Avenue 99 15124 Maroussi-Athens GREECE Tel. +302106114651 Fax. +302106114650";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.5.1 - Open Innovation for future Internetenabled Services in smart Cities";" Euro 4.52m";" Euro 2.26m";" 297291";" From 01/04/2012 to 31/03/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"15";"7"

Within this overall ambition, the main objectives of EUROPEANA INSIDE are: - To open up a significant critical-mass of new digital cultural content from European cultural institutions for delivery through Europeana, - To simplify significantly the process of contributing content to Europeana for cultural institutions and aggregators of all scales and types throughout Europe, - To help cultural institutions and aggregators overcome barriers to participation by part-automating the workflow by which content is made available to Europeana, and creating tools for the management of permissions and licensing, - To build on the framework of standards and protocols established under previous Europeana projects by ensuring that current and future generations of Collections and Digital Asset Management Software are âEuropeana-readyâ. - To support metadata enrichment in Content Provider systems (and thereby deliver value to participating organisations and their users) by creating a channel for enhanced content to flow back from Europeana as the central domain aggregator and point of access to local systems. This Best Practive Network will lead to a specific increase in content to Europeana of 960,000 records from 15 cultural heritage institutions and 5 aggregators. It will also open up the potential for up to 7000 cultural institutions (the installed user-base of the Collections Management Systems represented in EUROPEANA INSIDE) to share an estimated 30m records with Europeana and its users. **** Contact information **** POOLE Nicholas NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, CROMWELL ROAD WC2 09 SW7 5BD LONDON UNITED KINGDOM Tel. +44 2 072508340 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.2.1 - Aggregating content in Europeana";" Euro 4.00m";" Euro 3.20m";" 297292";" From 01/04/2012 to 30/09/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"26";"10"

"project-297300";"InGeoCloudS: INspired GEOdata CLOUD Services";"The INspired GEOdata CLOUD Services (INGEOCLOUDS) project aims at demonstrating the feasibility of employing a cloud-based infrastructure coupled with the necessary services to provide seamless access to geospatial public sector information, especially targeting the geological, geophysical and other geoscientific information. This kind of information possesses interesting characteristics like the size of the available data, the existing metadata descriptions (mostly according to the European Directive INSPIRE) and the current availability of related services that can be moved to the cloud. Among the project partners there are many with such data and services available under more traditional infrastructures that can be easily deployed to the cloud. One of the project challenges would be the linking of the partnersâ data among themselves and with relevant external datasets. On top of the basic cloud services the project plans to demonstrate the ability to built more intelligent services by using and combining data seamlessly integrated through the cloud. Based on the gained experience, the project will provide guidelines in order to support the partners and other stakeholders of public information in their efforts to move more of their services and data to the cloud in order to decide the best possible roadmap, the requirements of the underlying infrastructure that will be chosen as a host, the requirements for the services and the possible pros and cons of these choices. In summary we plan to provide the necessary documentation, the related analysis, the roadmap and a set of working services to support organizations that need to move large amounts of public sector information to the cloud. The service-based infrastructure created by the project can survive the pilot and demonstration phases since the partners plan to integrate it in their infrastructure and various charge-on-demand financial models can be employed to support it. **** Contact information **** CHER David 6, rue Roger Camboulives - BP 13633 - Cedex 1 6 31036 toulouse FRANCE Tel. +33 5 34 61 92 92 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.4.1 - Towards a cloud of public services";" Euro 3.07m";" Euro 1.54m";" 297300";" From 01/02/2012 to 31/07/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"8";"5"

Electric power solutions have proven to offer a potentially ground-breaking solution for more energy-efficient and less petrol-dependent vehicles and transport systems. The consortium aims to integrate regional initiatives which have been established all over Europe. However, it is known by everybody that electric vehicles (EV) are under-used due to their limitations and lack of peoples' confidence in this type of transport mode. The smartCEM project aims to minimize the current EV limitations, by applying advanced mobility services (EV-navigation, EV-efficient driving, EV-trip management, EV-charging station management) to existing multimodal electro-mobility transport modes. The combination of technology and electo-mobility aims to increase awareness and standardize the use of electrical mode. The objectives of the project are the following: 1. Prove that user acceptance of electrical vehicles can be increased by at least 15% thanks to smartCEM services. 2. Evaluate how much the efficiency of transport can be optimised, taking into account environmental sustainability. 3. Develop of tools for measuring, monitoring and assessing carbon emissions. 4. Identify and address all deployment elements such as business models, legal aspects and privacy 5. Optimization of the energy use in the vehicle and infrastructure. 6. Support pan-European interoperability by standardisation between operations performed by different services and facilitating the interoperability between different systems and vehicles. 7.

"project-297358";"eEnviPer: A single multi-purpose SOA platform that delivers environmental permissions services through the cloud of e-Government services and applications";"The Aarhus Convention (1998) established that sustainable development can be achieved only through the involvement of all stakeholders. It linked government accountability with environmental protection and focused on interactions between the public and public authorities in a democratic context. This has led to a clear need for public participation and consultation during the environmental permitting procedures. There is therefore a great need for a system that integrates relevant processes and services collected by public authorities and agencies, to enable them to model and deploy services, as a cloud of e-Government services that support environmental licensing procedures to citizens and businesses. For this purpose, basic operational services will be aggregated on the platform and will be offered to citizens as e-services. At the same time, the architecture of the platform will give the public administrations the opportunity to deploy easily new services, and existing procedures will be available as shared services. Geographical information services are critical for this system, since the decision making process of all stakeholders is dominated by information that has a clear spatial dimension. The eEnviPer project aims to test an existing single multi-purpose cloud platform based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) for providing software as a service in five different European countries. The project will demonstrate the benefits of SOA and cloud architecture by integrating complementary existing systems that support environment-related permit procedures and provide digital services for permitting authorities at different levels, enterprises, consulting services and civil society (either individual citizens or special interest groups such as NGOs). **** Contact information **** PAVLOU Ioanna MITROPOLEOS STREET 63 54623 THESSALONIKI GREECE Tel. +2310 253810 Fax. +30 2310 253819";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.4.1 - Towards a cloud of public services";" Euro 4.13m";" Euro 2.06m";" 297358";" From 01/04/2012 to 31/03/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"13";"6"

Current information systems of PAâs are based on monolithic architecture models that include all the application software levels (silos). This approach does not ensure any flexibility when new needs rise; in particular when the existing applications could be converted into basic services to mash up information, implementing new different applications. The Open-DAI project deals with the following main issues: the opening of the huge amount of data stored in PA databases to the wide audience of potential users; the evolution toward an open architecture model for the PA information systems in order to overcome the monolithic and closed architecture models (silos); to facilitate software maintenance of existing silos, enabling PA to pace the evolution of legacy systems with Open Data initiatives. The Open-DAI project aims to address the problems outlined above by testing the efficiency and added value of a SOA and Cloud-based architecture on several PA by: â¢ Implementing a data virtualization infrastructure deployed into a high availability infrastructure â¢ Simplifying access to legacy vertical applications data, by providing a virtualized version of the data bases in the Cloud â¢ Providing a new SOA data access layer, that could be combined in an appropriate manner in order to improve the products and services â¢ Implementing the PA âopen dataâ data hub, exposing it by using classic web services as well as other standard protocols.

This will be done by bootstrapping the involvement of open innovation ecosystems such as Living Labs in bringing the users together in the whole co-creation process using a self- centred methodology. iCity involve into the co-creation of services of public interest different types of stakeholders: private and third sector as new services developers, and citizens and companies as beneficiaries and final users of the new services. The project responds to the growing demand from social stakeholders to provide services of public interest based upon the exploitation of available public information, digital assets and infrastructure. In doing so, the project encompasses the concept of Open Data with a novel approach of Open Infrastructures where the available municipal ICT networks already deployed in urban spaces will be made available and accessible to open innovation ecosystems (specially SMEs) with the objective of maximizing the number of deployed services of public interest. The services to be finally deployed will be designed by interested user-driven open innovation ecosystems according to selected priority areas for cities and will be developed on the top of a shared technological platform that the iCity project will integrate in the 4 participant cities: Barcelona, Bologna, Genova and London. The iCity platform will enable services deployment using on due time appropriate municipal infrastructures in each city and providing a software development kit (SDK). Transferring will be assured by making the platform be ready to be integrated in any other interested city willing to shift into a Smart City and adopt the co-creation approach in services provision and also by making available services of public interest to the citizenship on an iCity Open Apps Store. **** Contact information **** FIORE Jordi TÃ nger 98 08018 Barcelona SPAIN Tel. +34 93 2918257 Fax. +34 93 2918418";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.5.1 - Open Innovation for future Internetenabled Services in smart Cities";" Euro 5.21m";" Euro 1.98m";" 297363";" From 01/01/2012 to 31/12/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"9";"5"

The Art Nouveau style was a great success all over Europe at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. It is well represented, in almost every art form, in museum collections, archives, libraries, photographic archives, and on buildings throughout Europe. After a short period of disinterest, with the arrival of modernist styles, it seems that Art Nouveau is now even more popular than ever. Because of this Partage Plus can count on an immense interest from a range of specialists, and from the public in general, who wish to know more about the masterful creations in this imaginative style. The objects, paintings, drawings, and sculptures from that period are now appreciated for the masterpieces of craftsmanship and originality they are. Furthermore Art Nouveau monuments are now recognized by UNESCO on their World Heritage List as significant contributions to cultural heritage. Partage Plus will create an access point to information (through the project website) and digital content (through Europeana) on the European cultural heritage of the Art Nouveau period. It provides a means and a structure for the digitisation of content from different domains and different countries and making it available for citizens using Europeana. WHY PARTAGE PLUS? Partage Plus aims to digitise over 76 thousand pieces of content for ingestion into Europeana. This will be carried out by the partners in the project. It will also use existing Art Nouveau in Europeana and encourage others with relevant collections to do the same. This amount of content represents a significant increase in the amount of Art Nouveau content available on the Web. It will also include masterpieces by: â¢ Victor Horta; â¢ Henri van de Velde; â¢ Charles Rennie Mackintosh; â¢ Alphons Mucha; â¢ Hector Guimard; â¢ Emile GallÃ©; â¢ RenÃ© Lalique; â¢ Paul Hankar; â¢ Josef Maria Olbrich; â¢ Wilhelm Jost.

The Pilot Actions are based on the use of Solid State Lamps (SSLs) combined with a particular method of providing power to them, in order to realize a Smart Energy Platform (SEP), mainly aimed at delivering an efficient lighting system. The SEP accommodates advanced ICT components and systems (e.g. smart metering, power electronics, mechanical/electrical sensors and actuators, etc.), that are designed to directly contribute to reducing energy losses and consumption. It integrates fine-grain sensor and control technology with a low voltage DC-powered network of highly efficient LED fixtures. This combination is able to provide more than 60% reduction in ongoing electricity costs, and is also able to reduce building maintenance costs. The capabilities of the proposed system will allow facilities managers to optimize their energy conservation strategies such as: dimming, daylight harvesting, demand response, peak reduction and activity sensing, by controlling non-critical lighting in a premises without disturbing its occupants. Measurement and analysis tools and metering indicators of energy performance, acting to demonstrate clear energy savings, have a relevant role in the Pilots. The goal of the experimental actions is to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ICT (SEP) solution for smart lighting, to serve as showcases to these technologies, and to facilitate their wider uptake and replication. **** Contact information **** CARLETTI Marilena VIALE DEL POLICLINICO 147 00161 ROMA ITALY Tel. +39 0654804303 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2011.1.2 - ICT for Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings";" Euro 2.41m";" Euro 1.20m";" 297386";" From 01/01/2012 to 30/06/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"14";"5"

"project-325087";"ProFouND: Prevention of Falls Network for Dissemination";"The Prevention of Falls Network for Dissemination (ProFouND) is a thematic network working with the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing to bring about the dissemination and implementation of best practice in falls prevention across Europe. ProFouND comprises 21 partners from 12 countries, with associate members from 10 countries. ProFouND aims to influence policy to increase awareness of falls and innovative prevention programmes amongst health and social care authorities, the commercial sector, NGOs and the general public in order to disseminate the work of the network to target groups across EU. Specifically ProFouND&rsquo;s objective is to embed evidence based fall prevention programmes for elderly people at risk of falls by using novel ICT and effective training programmes in at least 10 countries/15 regions by 2015 to facilitate widespread implementation. ProFouND will achieve this in three main ways.     * First, by collating evidence-based resources to inform the development       and content of a novel state-of-the-art online web-based expert system;       the ProFouND Falls Prevention Application (PFPApp). The PFPApp will       enable the creation of tailored, customised, up-todate best practice       guidance, that can be context and individual specific. For example, a       Falls Prevention practitioner in assessing the needs of an elderly       patient would ask a series of questions to inform the inclusion of best       practice guidance from a database of predefined evidence-based articles.       This advice, on aspects of health would be presented in an easily       understand and attractive printable leaflet, branded with institutional       logos, contact information and other bespoke information according to       what is available in the local area.     * Second, ProFouND, in collaboration with Later Life Training, will provide       a cascade model training programme using face to face and e-learning       approaches to create a cadre of accredited exercise trainers across       Europe to implement exercise regimens that have been proven to reduce       falls amongst older people. The idea here is that once trained, these       trainers would then in turn train instructors to deliver classes directly       to people who need this kind of intervention.     * Third, ProFouND will also create an &ldquo;ICT for Falls Forum&rdquo; to       identify evidence based solutions that can help reduce falls and engage       with industry to promote development and adoption of these solutions.       This forum will run events and reach out to promote MHealth capabilities       and European competitiveness in the sector. **** Contact information **** FAY Liz OXFORD ROAD M13 9PL MANCHESTER UNITED KINGDOM Tel. +44 161 2757114 Fax. +44 161 2752445";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.3.4 - Fall prevention network for older persons";" Euro 1.03m";" Euro 1.00m";" 325087";" From 01/03/2013 to 29/02/2016";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"21";"12"

It will contribute to the open data policy of the Commission and stimulate the reuse of public sector information from governmental, scientific and cultural sources. It brings together 19 partners from ten countries that have a background in hosting and facilitating open data competitions, providing data and supporting business ventures. Together, we will build on and align 20 existing local and national open data competitions held over the next two years by the partners and stimulate the participants to turn their inventions into viable businesses. The project will develop a new, transferable and tested programme, that will increase the business knowledge and potential for success of participants in open data competitions: the Business Lounge. The Business Lounge educates developers in creating and commercialising apps with market potential. Participants enter their prototype app, including a business model into an annual EU Open Data Competition. We will organise two such pan-European competitions, that bring the best of the local and national competitions into a European limelight and introduce them to a business network that will increase their potential. The categories of this EU open data competition are: Government, Science and Culture. The best local and EU contestants are invited to pitch their plans during a Pitch & Prize event for investors, incubators, international companies, entrepreneurial nonprofits and social investors. Additionally, the project spawns five support actions on themes that are identified as key areas of importance to organising successful open data competitions: Business and Policy; Data and Licensing; Media exposure for start-ups; Technical tooling and Community Building. **** Contact information **** VAN DER MOOLEN Karen NIEUWMARKT 4 1012 CR AMSTERDAM THE NETHERLANDS Tel. +31 20 557 9898 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.2.2 - Open Data and open access to scientific information";" Euro 0.60m";" Euro 0.60m";" 325090";" From 01/01/2013 to 30/06/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"19";"10"

"project-325094";"SPECIFI: Smart Platforms Enabling the Creative Industries for the Future Internet";"Focal areas that Smart Cities try to overcome are the reduction of pollution, traffic, or crime, and the introduction of models for public data. However, it is SPECIFIâs guiding principle that Smart Cities need to go beyond upgrades related to control tasks and public data. They can only become a success if they also become Smart Creative Cities, by employing open, Future Internet infrastructures to become thriving centres of arts, media and leisure. Creative Industries can create wealth through the generation and exploitation of IP, and include advertising, design, film and video, music, performing arts, printing, etc. Creative Industries lie at the crossroads between the arts, business and technology, making them a source of competitive advantage, not the product of wealth but the origin of it. The issue tackled by SPECIFI is to capitalize on the cultural and creative richness and diversity of European cities, while overcoming some of their key weaknesses, i.e. fragmentation and isolation. The promise of employing open Future Internet platforms and infrastructures in a smart, citizen-centred way, is to forge creative links between citizens, administrations and Creative Industry SMEs, between cities and their larger region, and between cities across Europe. SPECIFI will demonstrate the positive impacts of a European Creative Ring of Smart Cities and Regions, with real-life Future Internet (Fiber-to-the-Home and wireless) infrastructures, with real- life users and producers, and in 5 real (certified) Living Labs active in 3 smart cities and their surrounding regions. SPECIFI will demonstrate how cities can overcome technological limitations, geographical limitations and lack of sustainable business models. Hereby, they can become Connected Creative Cities through open Future Internet platforms and linking citiesâ âSuper-Creative Coreâ with other citiesâ Cores and with the broader region surrounding them. **** Contact information **** DE VOS Koen GASTON CROMMENLAAN 8/102 9050 GENT BELGIUM Tel. +32 9 331 48 60 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.1.3 - Open Innovation for Internet-enabled services and next generation access (NGA) in smart cities";" Euro 5.77m";" Euro 2.89m";" 325094";" From 01/01/2013 to 30/06/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"17";"5"
"project-325097";"IES Cities: Internet Enabled Services for the Cities accross Europe";"IES Cities is the last iteration in a chain of inter-related projects promoting user-centric and user-provided mobile services that exploit open data and user- supplied data. The technical components and achievements of several former European projects will be integrated to assemble an open Linked Data apps- enabling technological platform. Such platform will be deployed in different cities across Europe, allowing the citizens to produce and consume internet- based services (apps) based on their own and external open data related to the cities. Something specially remarkable about IES Cities is that no project before has considered so much the extent of the impact that the users may have on improving the open data in which services are usually based. The user- centred approach is a must for the success of the project. The target groups of the project will be citizens, SMEs, ICT-Developing companies and public administration. IES Cities will provide a user-centric urban apps enabling platform for users in four cities across Europe. Each city will initially test the functionalities of the platform with completely independent services, different at each location, in order to allow the cities and their citizens covering different needs under a common platform. Users will be able to continuously enrich the consumed services with their own data and to have a voice in the proposal and selection of new services to be developed. The set of pre-defined urban services defined is spefic to the cities where they will be deployed since not all cities count with the same data and the same needs for their citizens. These services will target different strategic topics in a city such as mobility, environment, health, culture, knowledge of the cities and so on. The project comprises partners from five different European countries who will deploy and validate the integrated open platform for enabling Linked Data urban apps in cities from three different countries in Europe. The cities involved will be Zaragoza (ES), Bristol (UK), Rovereto (IT) and Majadahonda (ES). **** Contact information **** PÃREZ VELASCO Jorge General MoscardÃ³ 32 28020 Madrid SPAIN Tel. +34663994684 Fax. +34944041445";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.1.3 - Open Innovation for Internet-enabled services and next generation access (NGA) in smart cities";" Euro 4.20m";" Euro 2.10m";" 325097";" From 01/03/2013 to 29/02/2016";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"13";"5"

The project consortium consists of 20 leading audiovisual archives, excellent media scholars, skilled technical service providers and the EBU. The partnership has established alliances with key stakeholders as the Europeana Foundation, FIAT/IFTA. EUscreenXL represents a considerable segment of Europeâs creative industries and has a particular strong link to the public service broadcasting community. It provides Europeana with about 1.000.000 metadata records giving access to digital content held by European providers, and 20.000 high quality contextualised programmes for public access on the EUscreen portal (in addition to the 40.000 already present). EUscreenXL extends thoroughly the operational EUscreen platform. By implementing cloud-based technologies a wide community of content providers will be able to contribute their content to Europeana. By providing functionalities to support quality contextualisation and re-use of digital content the project will use established web 2.0 practices â with a distinct scientifically driven approach. This ensures a balanced access to accurate content. Through three innovative user engagement pilots the project also develops and tests ways of usage within three target groups; the general public (re-use), researchers (digital humanities), and the creative industries (content delivery). EUscreenXL does not only try to define new coming audiovisual practices for the heritage domain and tackle the fragmentation within the audiovisual sector by establishing apt protocols. Most importantly, the project maximises awareness for a shared pan-European audiovisual content policy among archives, heritage institutions and broadcasters across Europe â and, in effect, substantially increases the online presence of digitised audiovisual heritage in Europeana. **** Contact information **** MÃLLER Eggo Muntstraat 2A 3512 EV Utrecht THE NETHERLANDS Tel. +31302538174 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.2.1 - Europeana and creativity";" Euro 4.96m";" Euro 3.75m";" 325100";" From 01/08/2013 to 31/07/2016";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"30";"21"

In particular, it will supply inscriptions coming from 25 EU countries, providing more than 1.5 M of images and related metadata, including translations of selected texts for the benefit of the general public. These represent approximately 80% of the total amount of inscriptions in the Mediterranean area. Furthermore, EAGLE will implement an inscription-specific metadata model based on standards and recommendations developed through related Europeana projects and a bespoke service platform for epigraphy to allow for multi-format ingestion and multi-device distribution of content and to bring new content providers and users to Europeana. Two Flagship Applications will be integrated to validate the projectâs results with real users and to step up the mass adoption of EAGLE: a mobile application to enable tourists to understand inscriptions they find on location, and a storytelling application to allow teachers and experts to assemble epigraphy-based narratives for the benefit of less experienced users. A multilingual wiki will be set up for the enrichment and curation of epigraphic images and texts, with special emphasis on translations - providing a basis for future translations of inscriptions in other European languages. The results of EAGLE will be disseminated to the epigraphers community and to the general public to ensure the sustainability of the project. To this end, EAGLE will foster a tight integration of its collections with Wikipedia through their publication to Wikimedia Commons and it will develop an inscription-themed documentary with a related teaser video. EAGLE will coordinate its activities with Europeana and with its sister projects therein to ensure full integration of services. **** Contact information **** ORLANDI Silvia Via dei Volsci 122 00185 Rome ITALY Tel. +39 3402382699 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.2.1 - Europeana and creativity";" Euro 3.75m";" Euro 3.00m";" 325122";" From 01/04/2013 to 31/03/2016";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"19";"12"

This approach will offer the basis for the validation of the introduction of technology-supported educational innovation in European schools, so that piloting and field testing results can be collated and analyzed systematically and then disseminated widely, thus ensuring real impact and widespread uptake. **** Contact information **** RAMFOS Antonis Building B1, Markopoulou-Paiania Av. 19km GR19002 Athens LUXEMBOURG Tel. +302106876482 Fax. +302106859166";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.2.3 - elearning for mathematics and science";" Euro 9.80m";" Euro 4.90m";" 325123";" From 01/04/2013 to 31/07/2016";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"30";"15"
"project-325132";"SABER: Satellite Broadband for European Regions";"The DAE has an objective to bring basic broadband to all Europeans by 2013 and by 2020 for all Europeans to have access to above 30Mbps with 50% or more of European households subscribing to internet connections above 100Mbps. Objective 5.3 of the ICT PSP Work Programme proposes that satellite communications represent a possible solution. To help achieve these targets, the SABER Thematic Network will bring together national and regional authorities, to analyse the experience of regions which have used satellite solutions to develop guidelines for deployment, share best practices and disseminate information to regions across Europe. SABER, coordinated by ERISA, is comprised of a triple helix of 26 partners including regional economic development organisations, intermediaries working with regions and leading European companies that operate across the entire satellite broadband value chain. SABER will work with regions in 3 streams to accommodate regions at different stages of readiness to explore satellite solutions. Regions in need across Europe will have available to them a common approach towards large-scale deployment of satellite solutions supporting the objective of 100% EU broadband coverage. These regions will have available to them guidelines and toolkits to support them in their endeavour to address their broadband needs, both now and into the future, through effective public sector intervention. These guidelines and toolkits will take into account satellite developments that are taking place and which could have a positive impact on the achievement of the DAE 2020 objectives. All SABER outputs will be widely disseminated and made available to regions and stakeholders across Europe using an information repository and a programme of round-tables, workshops and a conference. Beyond the lifetime of the project the partners will continue to maintain the information repository using their extensive networks to continue to disseminate the findings. **** Contact information **** VALLERO Vittorio CORSO UNIONE SOVIETICA 216 10134 TORINO ITALY Tel. +390113165935 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.5.3 - Contribution of satellite systems to 100% EU broadband coverage";" Euro 0.51m";" Euro 0.51m";" 325132";" From 01/11/2012 to 31/10/2014";" Closed";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme TN Thematic Network ";"26";"13"

Main projectâs goals are to: a) design and implement a EU-wide system to assess rights status (including Orphans) for all types of AV works by federating information resources of multiple national clearing centres; b) foster consensus among all stakeholders on key issues (as definitions of rights statuses, appropriate processes for diligent search, etc) thus facilitating progress on regulatory issues; c) solve interoperability problems among repositories, databases and registries across the EU so that all information required to define rights statuses are automatically harvested and processed; d) enable all stakeholders and users across the EU to assess the rights status of all AV works currently in a ârights-limboâ, thus enhancing access to and usage of a large portion of European AV content; e) establish and maintain a EU-wide Registry of AV Orphan Works and of diligent searches performed. These goals will be achieved by a strong collaboration of large national institutions that hold the largest information resources on AV works in their countries and representatives of all main stakeholders; the project will also build on the extensive expertise and experience of the ARROW projects, thanks to direct involvement of the ARROW project and partners. The FORWARD system will be designed, implemented and tested as a pilot application involving entities from 10 EU countries to be later expanded to all other potential partners in all other EU countries; it will be fully interoperable with ARROW and accessible to queries from all users across the EU. FORWARD will also foster standardization of AV rights metadata across the EU, and set up a structure ensuring that the system is maintained and expanded beyond the end of the project. The FORWARD and ARROW systems will be fully compatible and interacting realities, opening the possibility of further integration Directive 2012/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain permitted uses of orphan works was adopted on 25 October 2012. The FORWARD project will be aimed at helping the implementation of the orphan works directive by Film Heritage Institutions.

In the Aalborg Future Internet (FI) Assembly a number of EU cities (such as Santander, Aarhus, Berlin, Manchester) signed a manifesto targeting at exploiting and driving FI research for smart cities. Nevertheless, there are various dimensions regarding efficient service provision: technology, socio-economics, governance and legal. While research outcomes have been made available, yet the structured and rapid development of services that will shorten time to market and allow integrators (SMEs) to get involved into smart cities business is not supported. RADICAL will enable the development and deployment of interoperable pervasive multi- sensory and socially-aware services, by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) and Social Network (SN) technologies, emerging from leading edge R&D results from the SmartSantander, BonFIRE, SocIoS, and +Spaces projects. The RADICAL platform will also facilitate smart governance and flexible replication of services across cities and regions, through mechanisms that assess the citiesâ peculiarities in terms both of their technical infrastructures and of the socio-economical characteristics and the legal and governance environments. RADICAL will integrate, deploy and pilot seven services in the areas of Cycling Safety, Green Products Management, Data Journalism, Participatory Urbanism, Augmented Reality, Eco-consciousness and Commercial and transactional data for pedestrian flows. These services will be supported by five SMEs and accordingly replicated across six smart cities and one region. Over 3100 citizens will be actively involved in the co-creation, validation and evaluation of the RADICAL approach, on the basis of an innovative Living Labs approach, which will exploit SN information to involve representative users samples. **** Contact information **** PALOMARES Susana Calle de Albarracin 25 28037 Madrid SPAIN Tel. +34912148800 Fax. +34917543252";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.1.3 - Open Innovation for Internet-enabled services and next generation access (NGA) in smart cities";" Euro 5.50m";" Euro 2.75m";" 325138";" From 01/03/2013 to 29/02/2016";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"17";"6"

"project-325150";"RDI: Rights Data Integration";"Rights Data Integration (RDI) is an exemplary implementation of a framework being developed by the Linked Content Coalition (LCC) to demonstrate how participants in the content supply chain can manage and trade rights for any and all types of usage across any and all types of content (physical, digital or abstract) in any and all media under any (or no) commercial model, and to support the provision of information to Users, some of which lead to the securing of licenses, some of which may be automated. The LCC has developed out of an earlier project as a response to Commissioner Neelie Kroes call for âBig Ideas for the Digital Agendaâ. A significant constraint in the growth of the online content sector is the need for better solutions for discovering, licensing and delegating intellectual property rights, allowing potential users better information and access, and enabling creators and rightsholders to be properly rewarded. The development of a centralised platform to address the issue is not considered either practical or desirable. On the other hand, standardising the manner in which IP rights are expressed would lower barriers to entry to facilitate the development of a market for technology solutions: but it is not considered practical to replace existing rights metadata standards designed for individual media sectors with a single, all-encompassing standard. The proposed solution is to specify the essential standards framework for cross-media rights management and to encourage existing standards organisations to collaborate in creating interoperability and commonality using the LCC specifications. The unique and innovative feature of the LCCâs work is its Rights Reference Model which allows rights metadata for any kind of content to be integrated to any level of detail in a structure which is technology-neutral and extensible for future developments **** Contact information **** FARROW Andrew UNION STREET 164/180 SE1 0LH LONDON UNITED KINGDOM Tel. +44 20 7620 4433 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.2.1 - Europeana and creativity";" Euro 2.18m";" Euro 1.09m";" 325150";" From 01/10/2013 to 31/12/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"14";"7"

In order to address these topics the cities and industrial partners will jointly implement three cooperative services, Forward Collision Warning, Red Light Violation Warning and Energy Efficient Intersection service. These services will be piloted over one year of real life driving. Each of the pilot sites contains all partners for successful after-project life, from public authority to infrastructure supplier and users. The user groups will include commercial users, such as bus, emergency vehicle, truck and taxi drivers, as well as private drivers. In total the consortium aims to pilot 344 cooperative vehicles with more than 550 users. In addition to proving the benefits, the project aims at identifying deployment opportunities, barriers and finding solutions for those. Therefore an important part of the work will focus on defining business models, cost benefit analysis and exploitation plans. Another aspect that is of crucial importance for deployment is the global harmonisation of services. Consortium partners plan to cooperate closely with their US, and Japanese associates; contributing to global harmonisation of these services. Links with US and Japan are already well established and function through Compass4D partners work in the EU-US Task Force. Standardisation cooperation with ETSI and CEN is already very strong and the certification framework, required for pan-European and global deployment of these services will be further developed. Through all of this Compass4D aims to be the tool for European cities, road operators, vehicle fleets and all other road transport stakeholders, to support them in navigating on their way to sustainable deployment of cooperative services. **** Contact information **** JEFTIC Zeljko Avenue Louise 326 1050 BRUXELLES BELGIUM Tel. +3224000731 Fax.";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.1.2 - Cooperative Transport system for smart mobility";" Euro 10.00m";" Euro 5.00m";" 325179";" From 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"30";"10"
"project-325182";"EPLACE: Eco public PLAtform for smart green CityzEn’s living labs";"The first step in increasing energy efficiency in a building is to increase our understanding of how that building and its occupants use energy. EPLACE aims to provide building managers and occupants with, not only this data, but also an international web based collaborative platform where practical solutions, partnerships and knowledge exchange can be accessed and tailored specifically to their buildings energy profile. The project brings together partners from Spain, Germany, Bulgaria and Ireland and aims to test and validate innovative ICT solutions for metering specific energy sources in 7 pilot public buildings. These buildings have been specifically selected to represent the typical spectrum of public buildings in an urban municipality and include offices, leisure facilities, libraries, health facilities and a cultural centre. The technical aspect of EPLACE has four components: â¢Intelligent Energy Saving Account ISEA: An online platform for gathering data and suggesting recommendations. â¢WeSave: A smart energy monitoring system. â¢WeLight: Smart outdoor lighting monitoring and control system â¢WeTalk: A collaborative platform and social network The technology will be tested in the pilots in real life conditions for a period of at least twelve months, in parrell to this the building managers of the pilots will be trained in the use of ICT equipment and how this can be used to increase energy efficiency. The data will be displayed in âreal timeâ on ISEA platform and will form the basis of energy saving solutions for that particular building. These will take the form of awareness campaigns for staff, equipment upgrading and feasibility studies for engaging ESCOâs and other financial energy performance contracting. It is hoped that through the deployment of ICT building managers can save 15% of the energy consumption of the pilot building. EPLACE will conform to EU2020 goals for saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by validating the effectiveness of ICT solutions in public buildings, promoting information, good practice and dialogue among other users of the platform and by creating new business models for energy services based on accurate and verifiable energy data. The availability of accurate energy data and accessibility to a collaborative network of building managers and experts will empower the end user to make correct decisions on what solutions to employ to maximize energy efficiency for their building. **** Contact information **** ALAMOS MIRO Teresa CALLE CHARLES DARWIN SN, PABELLON MONORRAIL 41092 SEVILLA SPAIN Tel. +34954152706 Fax. +34954462465";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.1.1 - Smart urban digital services for energy efficiency";" Euro 1.45m";" Euro 0.73m";" 325182";" From 01/02/2013 to 31/07/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"10";"4"

We integrate the matured knowledge of our consortium into an integrated strategy ranging from adoption to governance, supported by a full service offer for controlling cyber security problems, particularly botnets. The proposed pilot addresses the identification, measurement, and analysis of botnets as well as the prevention, detection, mitigation, recovery, and evaluation of their impact. We present an end-to-end approach from detection to protection, manifested as five powerful services, operated by our member states. Service #1, the centralized clearing house, is our single point of contact for data storage and analysis. While offering a liberal input interface, the distribution of gained knowledge is done in a precisely defined data format, which is openly shared. Service #2, the support center, delivers structured information for stakeholders and affected end users, likewise. Here, disinfection tools can be downloaded and affected users, including small and medium enterprises, are supported in dealing with their incidents. Service #3 focuses on the detection and mitigation of infected websites, while the detection of network anomalies, including possible cloud- or mobile-based botnets, is subject to Service #4. Both services are operated in a decentralized and distributed manner in order to achieve a high degree of diversification. Obviously, all data acquired using Service #3 and #4 is sent to the centralized clearing house for further analysis. Service #5 aims on the integration of tools for identification and removal of malware (e.g., bots) from end user devices. The proposed pilot will enable ACDC to not only identify and shut down command and control servers but to eliminate the actual weapons of a botnet â the bots. **** Contact information **** IVANOV Ivo LICHTSTRASSE 43H 50825 KOLN GERMANY Tel. +490221700048250 Fax. +49221700048111";"The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme";" CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.5.1 - Cybersecurity";" Euro 16.34m";" Euro 7.77m";" 325188";" From 01/02/2013 to 31/07/2015";" Running";" The Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme PB Pilot Type B ";"28";"14"

High-resolution media streams serving a multitude of connected and synchronized devices form a perfect playground for a thriving digital ecosystem. The value of these services results from the merging of both linear and on-demand content delivery; anybody can profit from the possibilities of the broadband connection in retrieving extra content to the screen related to the broadcast or served on the basis of (automated) personal choice out of online online libraries. The amount of bandwidth needed, however, will be immense as these services are made available to the massive audience currently watching linear television channels. New media and TV production companies are adopting transmedia storytelling, taking the TV experience to mobile and web devices. Transmedia storytelling is a developing paradigm within TV production companies, and many new formats incorporate a transmedia concept. If transmedia storytelling could simultaneously integrate multiple HD streams on multiple devices, this would unleash radical new possibilities for production companies whose prime expertise is in producing moving image content. The TV-RING project is based around 3 pilot regions in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, and seeks to devise and demonstrate advanced Connected TV scenarios based on HbbTV platforms and NGA network infrastructures. The TV- RING pilots will operate as a community, aggregating and actively building up knowledge around best practice examples and processes in Connected TV service development.

It will integrate vast amounts of content from diverse repositories created in several large previous projects as well as from existing architectural design communities. MACE will provide a framework for community based services such as finding, acquiring, using and discussing about e-learning contents that were previously reachable only to small user groups. The project will build on top of several successful projects, including but not limited to, DYNAMO, INCOM, WINDS and ARIADNE. In addition to that, three members of the consortium are main content partners who have access to a large number of content providers or are themselves associations of architects and universities dealing with architecture and design. Therefore the project reaches a critical mass of digital content that grants a significant impact on the EU scenario concerning architecture and cultural heritage, and will become a base for further community activity in these domains. The project will develop and use several types of metadata for tagging contents: traditional content metadata and ontologies, context metadata, competence metadata and learning process metadata, usage related metadata and metadata acquired through social interaction, e.g. recommendations by peer users or blog entries. Close integration of universities as well as professionals ensures that demands from the user side are recognized and fitting solutions will be created. Since users are distributed across different countries in Europe, the project will address the multicultural and multilingual issues resulting thereof and create working solutions for sharing contents across borders. **** Contact information **** WOLPERS Martin Schloss Birlinghoven 53754 Sankt Augustin Germany Tel. +49 2241 14 2128 Fax. +49 2241 144 2128";"eContentplus Programme";" 4.2.1 - Stimulating educational content Enrichment - Content Enrichment Projects";" Euro 3.94m";" Euro 3.15m";" ECP-2005-EDU-038098";" From 01/09/2006 to 31/08/2009";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme CEP ";"13";"5"

The partners will bring together a critical mass of existing educational materials which they will enrich with semantically well- defined metadata. Metadata will be added to MELT content both by partners themselves and by teachers. The project will particularly explore the synergy between two different approaches to the enrichment of learning content involving a priori metadata (before use) added by expert indexers and a posteriori metadata (after use) gathered from both teachers/learners and machines. A key goal is to enrich the available content with metadata that reflects the actual use of each resourceby teachers/pupils in different learning contexts, in order to support the wider use of this content and the development of the European content market. To achieve this, partners will use an existing Brokerage System that supports federated searching so that MELT content can be made freely available to schools all over Europe. New approaches to social tagging and &lsquo;folksonomies&rsquo; will then be used, so that teachers may add their own metadata to MELT content, and a framework for automatic metadata generation will further increase the quantity of MELT metadata. As well as validating the MELT system with teachers through a test bed and experiments in schools, MELT will provide an evaluation and indicators demonstrating the added value of MELT content enrichment processes. **** Contact information **** DURANDO MARC Rue de TrÃ¨ves 61 1040 Brussels Belgium Tel.

The design and the production of high-quality digital content has turned out to be harder than expected, the main reason being that it requires expertise in several subject matters as well as expertise in several technologies. In the case of mathematics, the required areas of expertise include that of professional mathematicians, software engineers, publishers, and perhaps learning theorists. There is a critical mass of activity around the area of semantic markup for mathematics which is directly related to enhancing digital content, in particular e-learning of mathematics. Much of this activity is or has been sponsored by the EU (OpenMath, OpenMath-TN, WebALT, LeActiveMath, Genesis), some is sponsored by national agencies (MatTaFI, Serving Mathematics, EMILeA-stat, Moses, Mumie, MEMBERS, math-kit), some by multi-national consortia (W3C&rsquo;s MathML Interest Group, OpenMath Society), and some by private enterprise (NAG Ltd., Liguori Editore, Maths For More, ISN). The goal of the JEM thematic network is to pool together the required expertise and to contribute to the coordination of content enrichment activities in the area of mathematics, to the maintenance of agreed standards and to the delivery of powerful synoptic high-quality user information and support pages, invoked in e-learning platforms operated by the partners.

"project-ECP-2005-GEO-038026";"EGN: EuroGeoNames - developing a European geographical names infrastructure and services";"**** A European multilingual geographical names data infrastructure and support service. **** Access to consistent and reliable multilingual geographical names is essential for a number of uses including postal services, emergency services, navigation, tourism, property purchases, the mass media and applications (eg Google Earth). In all of these areas, geographic names provide one of the most important keys for referencing and accessing a variety of related information. The EuroGeoNames (EGN) project will provide access to multilingual geographical names data and related toponymic attributes (e.g. the language of the name, its gender, its related exonyms, its pronunciation, if it is available, etc.) via the Internet. The service will be equally accessible by all languages officially spoken in the participating European countries, and will include officially recognized minority languages. The appeal of a multilingual solution to Internet searches for geoinformation is apparent if one starts from the perspective of a user (picture left). Germans and Austrians may like to start their internet search with the geographical name Donau whereas a Hungarian may like to start with Duna, a Serbian or Bulgarian with Dunav, a Romanian or Moldovian with DunÄrea&ldquo; and a Slovakian or Ukrainian with &ldquo;Dunaj&ldquo;. From the technical point of view, the EuroGeoNames (EGN) project is creating a European infrastructure of differently organized geographical names data sources and is setting up an interoperable web services&rsquo; architecture compliant to open standards (specifically ISO and OGC WFS standards). An EGN Central (WFS) Service will access the distributed EGN Local (WFS) Services at each data provider (National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies - NMCAs) to query the EGN data network and return standardized result sets to the inquirer. Additionally, a database of exonyms and other variant names comprises important names of geographical features in the official languages, not maintained by the NMCAs. It is a supplement database to the EGN Central Service and will be linked to it by unique identifiers. The project consortium brings together partners from the public, academic and private sectors embracing the full &lsquo;value chain&rsquo; from data providers via technology partners to value added service applications. This lays the ground for a successful project that will make a major contribution to opening up public sector information within a wider European spatial (geographic) information infrastructure. **** Contact information **** ZACCHEDDU Pier-Giorgio Richard Strauss Allee 11 60598 FRANKFURT AM MAIN GERMANY Tel. +49 (0)69 6333 305 Fax. +49 (0)69 6333 441";"eContentplus Programme";" 3.1.1 - Promoting the enabling infrastructure for geographic information - Targeted Project";" Euro 1.80m";" Euro 0.90m";" ECP-2005-GEO-038026";" From 01/09/2006 to 28/02/2009";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP ";"10";"6"

Thus their usefulness and availability are limited, although geophysical information may be very effectively retrieved, processed and interpreted for a wide variety of purposes. The competitiveness of geodata handlers and organizations specialized in geodata processing will be enhanced with these databases integrated and accessed via the Internet, offering crossborder, European-wide, unified electronic services, making geophysical data much more available. Therefore an Internet-driven multilingual information system, integrating geophysical data coming from national data holdings, was designed, developed and set up, developing metadata and data representation standards supporting further integration and dissemination of European or global geoinformation holdings. The system is addressed to local and central authorities, oil, gas, mining and geothermal companies and operators, research and education institutions and citizens. It enables the project partners to adapt to the pressures for continuous innovation and technological challenge, due to enlargement and completion of European market and intensification of competition in the field of services based on geological, geophysical and environmental data. The developed information system forms an infrastructure for data sets electronic dissemination in a multilingual environment, offering automatic translation to the language required by a user, working in a multilingual environment of the system&rsquo;s user interface. Multilingualism in accomplishment with flexible support of varying data source formats opens wide space for cross border accessibility of national data sources. Originated software shows the way for the practical solution of national data integration and harmonization into common Pan European knowledge space. The developed, extended or adapted standards of geophysical data and metadata representation support easier use of the disclosed data holdings by various categories of users, for a wide variety of purposes. Thus, the GEOMIND project, aggregating data collections across national borders, contributes to making the digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable. The accessibility of data provided by the GEOMIND system are enriched by GIS- featured multilingual user interface, offering true trans-border geographic data selection, as well as standardized, multilingual querying facilities based on attribute component of metadata and header data. Using state-of-the-art technological solutions, based on multinational project consortium and offering new standards for data representation and retrieval, the GEOMIND initiative will contribute to improve geoscientific or environmental data searchability and exploitability. The system is extensible and offer the infrastructure for further enrichment of the content offered, by the incorporation of other categories of data, or new data suppliers joining the initiative, after the project&rsquo;s completion. The data are easily available for various groups of European citizens &mdash; like researchers, students etc. &mdash; irrespective of their country of residence, in 8 European languages. **** Contact information **** GUTOWSKI Jacek Rakowiecka 4 00-975 WARSZAWA POLAND Tel.

Geo-data market research has shown that the groundwater (geo-hydrological) data is of great market demand, occupying the second position in the rating list immediately after the data on rock composition (lithology). This data is currently stored in national databases and available exclusively for a national user in a local language. Therefore the geo-hydrological data across the national borders form separated, uncorrelated, not interoperable data sets. As the result much of the geo-hydrological spatial information is difficult to exploit in both international and national water management context. In order to achieve the main objective the project will develop an Internet system that will provide cross-border multi-lingual access to ground water spatial data sets stored in the national databases of the participating countries. The developed eWater Web portal will serve as a common entrance and the meeting point for all those, who have stakes in cross-border management issues, including EC. The portal will primarily concern groundwater monitoring measurements, such as water level and chemical composition, as well as digital geo-hydrological and geological maps. A plan for the portal&rsquo;s continued maintenance and augmentation will be developed in order to provide sustainability of the system after the end of the project. **** Contact information **** TCHISTIAKOV Alexei Scheomakerstraat 97 2600 JA DELFT NL Tel. +31 (30) 256 4961 Fax.";"eContentplus Programme";" 3.1.1 - Promoting the enabling infrastructure for geographic information - Targeted Project";" Euro 2.39m";" Euro 1.20m";" ECP-2005-GEO-038214";" From 01/09/2006 to 31/08/2008";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"15";"13"

Building on a small- scale pilot, the members of the Nereus Consortium, including many of the top- twenty European academic economics institutions, together with other leading European economics research institutes, are proposing to create a networked service providing open access to economics information. Based on the content of the Institutional Repositories of the partners, the project takes an international, subject-oriented approach which will set standards, guaranteeing the quality of the information and, as a result, providing the branding which can act as a model for others to follow. The project will establish a central multilingual portal with enhanced metadata descriptions of and links to the full-text research publications and primary data output of a) 500 top researchers and b) the recent economics publications of the partner institutions. The content from the partner institutions will be complemented by other open access economics content. The portal will provide appropriate services for various user communities, i.e. researchers, students and policy makers in the public and private sectors.  The research output will also include primary datasets with links to the publications based upon them. The project will aggregate the currently uncoordinated economics research output of the major institutions and, supported by content submission workflow guidelines and IPR guidelines for authors, create a critical mass and an economy of scale that individual collections cannot hope to achieve.

Its appeal for the general, and especially the young public lies with its experimental, innovative and often audacious way to question and challenge but also render homage to the role of media in our lives, with all its ambiguity. In the face of this, media art archives have an invaluable importance amongst modern art collections. Yet, if the existing digital media art libraries are accessible only with difficulty for cultural or scholarly stakeholders, how much more so must they be for the general interested public. Use and re-use of the archives' digital content are totally disproportionate to the importance of media art in contemporary culture. GAMA is a project to correct this incongruity. GAMA will establish a central platform to enable multilingual, facilitated and user-orientated access to a significant number of media art archives and their digitalized contents. The consortium comprises of a majority of the most important digital content holders for media art in Europe. The content provided constitutes approx. 2/3 of all digital material on media art placed online by European libraries. This amount will ensure a significant increase in use, re- use and cross-border visibility of the digital content when aggregated and accessible through one common interface. GAMA will quickly develop to be the European central online interface and search portal for any person interested in media art. GAMA will consolidate the extremely heterogeneous landscape of digital media art archives, libraries and other digital content providers for the users. The consortium includes highly qualified technical partners with vast expertise in the field of digital media art archives.

The project will identify and bring together owners of complementary types of top quality digital educational content, enhance their existing content with domain ontology based metadata using state of the art annotation tools, develop and implement a shared quality control procedure for both pedagogic and scientific peer-review and tailor an advanced multilingual content search and editing tool to help content developers in constructing pedagogically sound educational packages. Final aim is to establish the European reference portal for genetics that enables authors to develop multimedia educational content better, faster and with lesser resources. **** Contact information **** STEVENS Richard Via S Vitale 40/3/d 40125 BOLOGNA IT Tel. +39 051 42 92 009 Fax. +39 051 63 64 004";"eContentplus Programme";" 4.1 - Targeted projects for educational content";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" ECP-2006-EDU-410018";" From 01/10/2007 to 30/09/2010";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"20";"11"
"project-ECP-2006-EDU-410019";"KeyToNature: KeyToLife: interactive e-tools for learning and teaching biodiversity";"KeyToNature aims to achieve a pan-European approach to teaching biodiversity, focusing on the identification of organisms. Until now, species identification was mainly based on paper-printed tools, such as dichotomous keys, which have several educational drawbacks. However, software tools have been developed which enable the creation of interactive identification tools for any group of organisms. Such tools are much more user-friendly than traditional paper- printed keys, can be easily adapted to different educational levels and enable the rapid production of a high number of varied identification tools. Their introduction into the educational world will overcome one of the most serious gaps in biodiversity education: the lack of identification tools adapted to user-specified needs. These tools require the connection of different - presently scattered - databases, including images, sounds, textual descriptions, thesauri of scientific and common names. In particular, KeyToNature plans to improve the searchability and usability of existing digital contents for the emergence of a European educational service related to teaching and learning biodiversity with novel, advanced, and powerful approaches. This raises a series of novel issues and problems, which require solutions at the European level. The main objectives of the project are to: 1) increase access and simplify use of eLearning tools for identifying biodiversity, 2) address interoperability among existing databases for the creation of identification tools, 3) optimise educational efficiency and increase quality of educational contents, 4) add value to existing identification tools by providing multilingual access, 5) suggest best practices against barriers that prevent the use, production, exposure, discovery and acquisition of the digital contents required for designing the identification tools. **** Contact information **** HUDSON Raymond   ITALY Tel.

The project will build upon the state of the art developments as regards the interoperability architectures and metadata standards and the latest evolutions in learning technologies to perform an extended validation on the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed approach in the science teaching and learning. The COSMOS approach will be implemented at two levels:     * at secondary education: The COSMOS approach will make educational       materials (educational scenarios, lesson plans, collaborative projects       with the associated content) easily accessible for creative, hands-on       interactive science lessons to meet the needs of school curricula. These       would be suitable for small-group collaborations and would include       automated image acquisition service and/or observatory control as       required to complete the lessons, plus the use of copyright material on       our project's portal.     * at university education: The databases of the observatories of the COSMOS       network will be used to improve the quality of science instruction at the       university level, while offering to the students the opportunity to       realize their own projects and to gain experience in carrying out       independent scientific research. Astronomy (or other closely related       fields) students and faculty can use our service for teaching practical       astronomy laboratory techniques and research astronomy courses (that is,       a minimum of related theoretical background is required).

These virtual patients will be available under a Creative Commons Licence **** Medicine and healthcare face the problem that opportunities for student-patient contact, which is at the heart of clinical competency, is declining in most member states. Training is hampered by two important factors: the healthcare budget constraints that increasingly limit clinical teaching, and the reduction in the time that patients stay in hospital. Electronic virtual patients (VPs) are now recognised by the medical education community as very effective tools for developing clinical reasoning. However, VPs are time-consuming and expensive to produce, and even leading e-learning institutions cannot produce a sufficient number to give full coverage of the medical or healthcare curricula. In 2005, several of the major European e-learning centres in medicine and healthcare formed a working group for the development of a pan-European collection of VPs. Together with MedBiquitous the leading developer of healthcare standards, this group began to define a standard for the interoperable use of virtual patients across Europe. This ongoing activity has now provided a unique opportunity. The large collection of electronic virtual patents which already exists between the partners will be pooled, adapted to a common technical standard, and 320 repurposed for multicultural, multilingual access. Non-partner institutions will be able to repurpose these VPs for their own local and educational needs. The shared bank of VP resources will cover the entire range of specialisms required to support clinical training. These shared resources can be used to maximise VP uptake by educators in both partner and non-partner countries to underpin and extend current teaching and learning, minimise inefficient practice, reduce costs, and improve the consistency and quality of clinical care and wellbeing of patients throughout the EU. **** Contact information **** BALASUBRAMANIAM Chara Cranmer Terrace SW17 0RE London UK Tel. +44 208 725 5813 Fax. +44 20 8725 0806";"eContentplus Programme";" 4.1 - Targeted projects for educational content";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" ECP-2006-EDU-410030";" From 01/09/2007 to 31/08/2010";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"9";"6"

Repositories address this missing knowledge about opportunities and resources. They are key disseminators of information of available learning resources. In repositories users search or browse for relevant resources (text books, websites etc.) among the vast supply on the market. Therefore, in many countries ministries of education/authorities or professional organisations have established national repositories of educational resources. The objective of this Thematic Network is to bring together these web-based repositories of learning resources with content owners and other stakeholders within education in order to share, develop and document strategies, experiences, practices, solutions, advice, procedures etc. on the organisation, structuring and functionality of repositories. The overall goal is to improve the provision of and access to learning resources. Issues to be addressed include: • Policies and strategies • Quality criteria and assurance • Rights protection and management • Standards and interoperability • Development and harmonisation/mapping of application profiles • Types of learning resources • Involving commercial publishers and associated agreements • Encouraging teachers' knowledge sharing • Linking to reviews and evaluations • Connecting to curriculum • Ethics, screening and clearing, and • Web-services bridging to other portals and local learning platforms. The project will link to/collaborate with other cross-national and/or local repositories/ collections/catalogues, and publishers&rsquo; associations. The project will develop practical guidelines and recommendations, but most importantly, it will establish a lasting collegial network of European repository nodes and stakeholders. The main output of the EdReNe project will be a comprehensive website with recommendations, documentation, templates, roadmaps and documents describing issues, state-of-the-art and offering possible solutions to the problems described above.

An analysis of the current situation shows that the target set for Europeana can best be met with targeted support for museums and audiovisual archives. ATHENA has the objective to:   - reinforce, support and encourage the participation of museums and other institutions coming from those sectors of cultural heritage not fully involved yet in Europeana;  - contribute to the integration of the different sectors of cultural heritage, in cooperation with other projects more directly focused on libraries and archives, with the overall objective to merge all these different contributions into Europeana;  - develop a set of plug-ins to be integrated within Europeana, to facilitate the access to digital contents belonging to European museums. ATHENA will also produce a set of scalable tools, recommendations and guidelines, focusing on multilingualism and semantics, metadata and thesauri, data structures and IPR issues, to be used within museums for supporting internal digitisation activities and facilitating the integration of their digital content into Europeana. All these outputs will be based on standards and guidelines agreed by the partner countries for the harmonised access to the content, and will be easily applicable. The final aim of ATHENA is to bring together relevant stakeholders and content owners from all over Europe, evaluate and integrate standards and tools for facilitating the inclusion of new digital content into Europeana, so conveying to the user the original and multifaceted experience of all the European cultural heritage.

To date, digitised collections of moving images and cinema-related material are dispersed, lacking the possibility of domain- specific search and access across the various repositories, institutions and countries. Considerable challenges exist in several fields: The problem of lacking coherence in digitisation practice and metadata standards across the film archives and cinÃ©mathÃ¨ques has to be tackled in order to provide for the basic technical and semantic preconditions for integrated access. Furthermore, the solving of IPR issues is crucial for providing access to both digitised moving images and cinema-related material. Both challenges can only be met in a collaborative way by building a network of film institutions around the actual task of providing integrated access to federated digital repositories. EFG specifically addresses the issues of IPR management, digitisation best practices and technical and semantic interoperability. Best practices and standards will be adapted and promoted in each of these three fields. The publicly visible result will be an internet platform providing advanced search facilities and access to federated digital collections. With its 23 partners from 14 EU member states (plus Norway and Switzerland), the network provides a critical mass of approximately 840.000 digitised items including more than 70.000 moving image items with a total duration of approximately more than 25.000 hours for testing approaches at overcoming the existing barriers in the fields of copyright and metadata as well as content (essence) standards. Also, an approach at providing basic multi-lingual features will be made. Through its unified, result-driven setup and strong network of partners, the project supplies the evolving European digital library with access to Europes extraordinarily rich film culture. **** Contact information **** ECKES Georg Schaumainkai 41 60596 FRANKFURT AM MAIN DE Tel. +49 69 - 96 12 20 631 Fax. +49 69 - 96 12 20 999";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 5.63m";" Euro 4.50m";" ECP-2007-DILI-517006";" From 01/09/2008 to 31/08/2011";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"20";"15"

There is a pressing need to involve Europes network of local and regional museums and archives, as well as libraries, more extensively in making the enormous amount of digital content that they hold available through the EDL. Such involvement will bring together a rich diversity of content of all types, cultures and languages making it possible to establish integrated services with great richness and adding value for communities and individual users. EDLocal will work with the EDL Foundation to establish efficient and sustainable processes through which local and regional institutions can easily make their contents available to the EDL during and after the project, adopting and promoting the use of its infrastructures, tools and standards, as specifications emerge, especially OAI-PMH repositories and the EDL Metadata Application Profiles initially but moving forward to semantic web technologies later. EDLocal builds on existing multiplier networks of local institutions to bring together a consortium that represents 27 countries states with broad ranging experience of the cultural sector, digital libraries, standards and aggregation services. EDLocal will make over 20 million items available to the EDL. The expected results include the establishment of a network of regional repositories that are highly interoperable with the EDL, an integrated EDL-EDLocal prototype service and the development of thematic areas for EDL services which integrate content from both the national and the local/ regional level. **** Contact information **** LEWANDOWSKI Szymon   NORWAY Tel.

Providing all Europeans with easy online access to the content of the collective memory contained in archives, will be an important contribution to the realisation of European social and cultural objectives. With the rapidly growing number of archives services using the Internet for the dissemination of their holdings and their growing competence in using the new technologies, the creation of an European Archives Internet Gateway (Internet Gateway for Documents and Archives in Europe) which pools efforts and expertise at the national and European levels, has been defined as a top priority by European professionals, and endorsed by the European Council in its recommendation of 14 November 2005 (Official Journal of the European Union, 29.11.2005; 2005/535/EC). The fundamental aim of the APEnet project is to provide EU citizens, public authorities and companies with a common gateway, which will enable them to find out for themselves about Europe's archives and about archival material that is relevant to them, whether or not they live in the European Union. Archives across the European Union will be easily accessible to EU citizens for the first time from a single entry point, and should improve public understanding of European history and culture. Therefore Archives Portal Europe will also have a strong relationship with the Europeana and other European portals or gateways which hold information on archives. The gateway will connect disparate archival Internet initiatives and will act as a powerful catalyst in breaking down the remaining barriers to easy access to information about archives in the European Union and the important cultural resources which they hold, making them available through a virtual catalogue.

The network comprises of 12 multi-media content providers from 9 European countries. Much of the content belongs to the thematic field of bio-diversity and is thus well suited for different usage scenarios, ranging from preservation to research, education and broadcasting, including significant practical issues such as IPR. Several of the institutions also have considerable technical and methodological expertise with digitised resources. They are supported by two experienced research and technology providers - one research organisation as coordinator and one commercial firm as the provider of the core technology which was originally developed in national and European projects. The consortium has the technical, methodological and content-related resources to demonstrate a European roll-out of novel access paradigms to eContent assets. The approach is based on reference structures, a pragmatic yet principled approach to using semantic web techniques for connecting heterogeneous data from different content providers, while leaving local organisational and data processing environments intact. The work plan identifies several well-defined target user groups both on the supply and the demand sides of eContent. The new techniques will demonstrate how cultural assets can be re-contextualised, how value can be added not only by experts but also by the interested public, and there will be measurable outcomes: (1) a theme-oriented European semantically rich information space; (2) a methodology for content enrichment; (3) guidelines for implementing the STERNA architecture; (4) partnership agreements for new partners to join the network; (5) an extension plan for further European roll- out; (6) a road show in Europe to demonstrate the system; (7) a cooperation agreement with the European Digital Library to ensure sustainability of the digital resources in a federation of contributors. **** Contact information **** MULRENIN Andrea   AUSTRIA Tel.

The current lack of widely accepted standards and their adoption hinders the effective implementation of learning technologies. Driven by a consortium of key players in the European arena ICOPER will access to a critical mass of more than 12,500 hours of integrated educational content. Based on this beneficial infrastructure the project will systematically analyze the implementation of existing specifications such as IMS RCDEO, IMS LD, SQI, and QTI. ICOPER&rsquo;s underlying educational framework will guide a consensus building approach to developing Best Practices, addressing issues such as (1) exchange of competency models and learning outcomes, (2) collaboration around learning designs, (3) integration of content via federated search and harvesting, (4) reuse of instructional models and content in learning deliver environments,  (5) interoperability of item banks for assessment and evaluation. ICOPER will provide mechanisms to ensure European-wide user involvement, cooperation, and adoption of standards within a large community to support all phases of standardization. Liaison management will condense findings into an ICOPER Reference Model which will be fed back to standards bodies and disseminated via the ICOPER Institute for Training &amp; Consulting. **** Contact information **** SIMON Bernd Augasse 2-6 1090 Vienna Austria Tel. 43 1 31336 4328 Fax. 43131336904328";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 6.00m";" Euro 4.80m";" ECP-2007-EDU-417007";" From 01/09/2008 to 28/02/2011";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"23";"17"

Initially, 14 content providers add additional content (both professionally produced and user-generated by teachers/pupils) to a critical mass of educational resources in an existing Learning Resource Exchange (LRE) for schools. This is a federated network of 20 learning content repositories that has been developed by European Schoolnet and its supporting MoEs together with other partners that include the ARIADNE Foundation. Technology providers and standards&rsquo; experts in the project work with ASPECT content providers to develop best practice approaches to implementing standards for both educational content discovery and use. Content providers apply these best practice approaches to a critical mass of resources in the expanded LRE. These resources are then validated with up to 40 schools in four countries in order to determine how the implementation of standards and specifications in the project leads to greater usability of LRE content. Based on this practical implementation of standards, which will be independently evaluated, ASPECT partners will feed the project&rsquo;s experience into pre- standardisation activities and run an extensive set of dissemination actions that include international workshops, plugfests, regional events and an award. The aim is to involve a wider group of organisations in ASPECT activities and to develop a unique co-operation framework for all stakeholders who will also benefit from a set of new support services that include: - LOR registry; - vocabulary bank for education; - application profile registry - automatic translation service for LOM and content packaging formats - compliance testing - transformer services; and - access to known interoperability issues. As a result of its work, the ASPECT project will have a strategic impact on pre-standardisation activities and the ability of partners to submit and support proposals to European and international standardisation bodies. **** Contact information **** MASSART David Rue de TrÃ¨ves 61 1040 Brussels Belgium Tel.

The proposal aims to create the conditions that will facilitate the co-existence, the use and the exchange of curriculum- related digital video, provided by Educational TVs & video producers, and of video and video-based pedagogical resources (learning activities) generated by pupils and teachers, in order to meet emerging learning needs and innovative practices at school level. The solution is based on the effective adaptation, extension and integration of existing digital educational video resources and services, robust technical solutions, pedagogical knowledge, best practices and success stories, in order to provide an innovative, hybrid, content-based e- service to the educational community. An on-line, trans-European, curriculum- related video clip library is created by segmenting the professionally produced digital videos to core-content video clips and semantically integrating them via common metadata and a multilingual ontology of multinational curricula concepts. A robust video publishing & management platform is extended to support video uploading by teachers and pupils and is integrated with an established Learning Content Management System to form the EduTubePlus Platform. Additional e-services will allow the on-line creation, upload and sharing of video-based learning activities by educators and teachers, taking advantage of the metadata and indexes of the integrated video library and supported by a sound pedagogical framework. Online video translation and localisation services, along with the ontology, support multilingual and multicultural access and use of the librarys content. The EduTubePlus educational e-service, with a high degree of security and availability, will be evaluated in real conditions in schools, extending the existing paradigms of video use in class, creating an active educational community and providing valuable feedback. This hybrid trans-European video-based e-service develops new business models for the Educational TV and video market and the market of Internet based services for schools, one of which is evaluated within the context of the project. **** Contact information **** MEGALOU Elina Davaki Str 10 GR-11526 Ampelokipi, Athens GR Tel. +30 210 6930700 Fax. +30 210 6930750";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 4.49m";" Euro 2.25m";" ECP-2007-EDU-427003";" From 01/09/2008 to 28/02/2011";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"16";"12"
"project-ECP-2007-EDU-427015";"SHARE.TEC: SHAring digital REsources in the Teaching Education Community";"Teacher Education (TE) is a strategic field for Europes knowledge society and is undergoing a process of rapid evolution. SHARE-TEC supports this process by creating a digital environment that fosters access, retrieval and reuse of resources for TE across Europe. The underlying vision is that digital resources are vectors of educational innovation which can help build bridges among the different cultures of the member states. The SHARE-TEC system is an extendible federated aggregation of resources, providing access both to the partners own content and to other TE repositories. This is made possible by a metadata migration process featuring semantic, linguistic and cultural interoperability. The intended users of the system are teacher educators, teachers engaged in self-guided learning, and developers and publishers of digital resources for TE. SHARE-TEC is adaptive to the specific needs of these users and takes into account their professional profiles through an ontology-based approach designed to capture national differences. SHARE-TEC covers both professionally- developed, commercially-distributed content and open resources created by users, proposing an innovative model for managing their coexistence in a sustainable fashion. Efficient brokerage is offered between federated TE resources and user demand, which is strongly influenced by a variety of personal, curricular, cultural and national factors. To improve the matching mechanism, SHARE-TEC integrates a folksonomy based approach and personalisation functions such as user history. Since educational resources are typically rooted in local cultures, the project will have a strong focus on cross- cultural aspects so that the users can benefit from contents developed in external contexts. User involvement is an essential feature of SHARE-TEC and accordingly the project establishes a network of user communities that will continue beyond project completion, thus strengthening sustainability. **** Contact information **** ROEDER Marc   ITALY Tel. +390106475303 Fax. +390106475300";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 3.40m";" Euro 1.70m";" ECP-2007-EDU-427015";" From 01/06/2008 to 31/05/2011";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"8";"6"

For those outside the Survey, or nation they are not easy to obtain, to understand, or use. Geological data are essential to the prediction and mitigation of landslides, subsidence, earthquakes, flooding and pollution. Geology is a key dataset in INSPIRE (Annex II). It is needed for the Groundwater and Soils Directives, GMES and GEOSS. OneGeology-Europe will make geological spatial data held by the Geological Surveys of Europe discoverable and accessible and see Europe play a leading role in the global OneGeology initiative. The project will accelerate the development and deployment of a nascent international interchange standard for geology, GeoSciML, enabling the sharing of data within and beyond the geological community. It will facilitate re-use of geological data by a wide spectrum of public and private sector users. It will address the licencing and multilingual aspects of access and move geological knowledge closer to the end- user where it will have greater societal impact. The project will provide examples of best practice in the delivery of high resolution digital geological spatial data to users, e.g. in the insurance, property, engineering, mineral resource and environmental sectors. The results of the project will be: an interoperable geology spatial dataset at 1:1 million scale for all EU; a scientific and informatics specification for the harmonisation of geological data and significant progress towards a harmonised dataset; a view service providing access to best practice high resolution geological spatial data services for 6 Member States; 2-4 case studies on cross-border delivery of harmonised high resolution data access; multilingual discovery metadata for all data provider participants geological and applied map data; a robust data model, schema and mark-up language for the geosciences, which is OGC compliant; a web portal providing easy multilingual access to the above data and examples of user-focused web services; best practice examples of the delivery of geological data to a range of users; guidance and proposed code of practice on licencing and clearing arrangements facilitating re-use of geological spatial data; exchange of science, technology, informatics and communication skills and experience across the EU and globally. These achievements will allow substantial progress towards INSPIRE goals and not only benefit the geology theme but also provide a template for other environmental data themes. OneGeology-Europe will deliver data for the EU Geoportal and position Europe as the world leader in developing a geoscience SDI. **** Contact information **** JACKSON Ian   UNITED KINGDOM Tel.

"project-ECP-2007-GEO-317002";"EURADIN: European Addresses Infrastructure";"**** EURADIN (European Addresses Infrastructure) aims at constituting a Best Practice Network to promote the European Addresses harmonization. **** INSPIRE Directive lays down general rules for the establishment of an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe, based on Spatial Data Infrastructures created by the Member States and that are made compatible and interoperable. Addresses are part of Annex I of INSPIRE, and will therefore be part of the aforementioned European Spatial Data Infrastructures. Over the last decade it has become commonly acknowledged that good address systems constitute a very important part of a society&rsquo;s infrastructure. In everyday life and in an infinite number of applications (Cartography, Cadastre, postal services, health and risk management, rescue services, Navigation tools, Transportation and logistics, emergency situations management, telecommunications, tourism…), addresses are used as a common reference. The number of these IT applications is very big, having as users both the public and private sector. Given the importance of an Addresses Infrastructure as a useful tool for public and private services, it is logical to expect the European Union should have an adequate European Address Infrastructure allowing the access in a seamless and interoperable way tothe existing European Addresses. At this moment, nothing that could be considered as a European Address Infrastructure exists. From a European point of view, the lack of harmonization regarding European addresses definition, registration and access, prevents a European Addresses Infrastructure from being built, which consequently means that addresses cannot be adequately and extensively used, shared and exploited by European public and private sector. EURADIN (European Addresses Infrastructure) aims at constituting a Best Practice Network to promote the European Addresses harmonization. The emphasis will be put in defining how access to existing address data should be made to ensure the interoperability of existing address data and working out a strategy on how to build up access services to national or regional addresses infrastructures. The project main result will be the proposal for the European addresses Infrastructure and the implementation, testing, and validation of a pilot European Addresses Infrastructure. The results shall be used as a reference for all European Member States to fulfil the INSPIRE recommendations with respect to addresses. **** Contact information **** VALENTIN GONZALEZ ANDRES   SPAIN Tel.

Dalai Lama **** The establishment of Natura 2000 and the new transboundary EU approach for protected sites management has enforced the link between nature conservation and geo-information. This has generated the need for interoperable and accessible EU harmonised datasets. The link is also addressed by the INSPIRE Directive which pursues an EU Spatial Data Infrastructure to support environmental policies. Nature-SDIplus Network aims, through state-of-the-art methodologies and best practice examples, to improve harmonisation of national datasets and make them more accessible and exploitable. Therefore, it contributes to the INSPIRE implementation with specific reference to a cluster of data themes on nature conservation (as per the INSPIRE Annexes): - Protected sites (Annex I); - Biogeographical regions, Habitats and biotopes, Species distribution (Annex III). The main objective of Nature-SDIplus Network is to: involve new stakeholders; share data and best practices; improve and stimulate exploitation and the re- use of information on nature conservation. The proposed project will analyse the usability and accessibility of data. The results of this analysis will be used to propose a new work item for a standard metadata profile and data model compliant with the INSPIRE Directive and in coordination with CEN/TC 287 Geographic information. Representative datasets will be provided by the partners from many EU Member States. The proposed project will define a common multilingual and multicultural approach for a simpler, standard access to spatial data. A demonstration geoportal, supported by web services, will provide data accessibility for the different stakeholders. This geoportal will then afford a means to actively engage the stakeholders. Through networking activities a Nature-SDIplus Community will be established. This Community will address the relevant themes on a consensus building approach. This Community will also demonstrate the effectiveness of the Nature- GIS thematic SDIC that is already registered with INSPIRE.

Although content is now being digitised and some of it is available online, access to audiovisual archives, television in particular, remains fractured and scattered, due to: the lack of interoperability both at the level of metadata and semantics; the non-existence of proven scenarios for the use of audiovisual material; the complexity of rights issues and the lack of contextualisation. EUscreen will tackle these problems by building a network of content providers, standardisation bodies and specific user groups around the task of providing multilingual and multicultural access to television heritage. Building on EBU Core and open web standards EUscreen will work towards standardization and provide the technical solutions needed to achieve interoperability between the audiovisual collections of Europe themselves and with Europeana in particular, for which EUscreen will deliver the audiovisual content. It will develop long- term solutions to rights issues. EUscreen will support user-led demand and interest for services and content as well as the development of scenarios for using this content in different contexts (research, learning, leisure and creative reuse), whilst also providing contextual information on the available resources.

The deployment of a set of management tools will enable the underlying community of practice to adapt and apply controlled vocabularies, thesauri and ontologies for the indexing, retrieval and re-use of the aggregated content in the area of interest. JUDAICA will deliver recommendations and guidelines focusing on the digitisation workflow, multilingual access, IPR issues and business models that will support the participant institutions in making their content available and integrate it into Europeana. **** Contact information **** SCHMITT Mareike Senckenberganlange 31 60325 FRANKFURT AM MAIN GERMANY Tel. +49-69 798 25194 Fax.";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 3.00m";" Euro 1.50m";" ECP-2008-DILI-538025";" From 01/01/2010 to 31/12/2011";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"10";"7"

The aim of mEducator BPN is to implement and critically evaluate existing standards and reference models in the field of e-learning in order to enable specialized state-of-the-art medical educational content to be discovered, retrieved, shared and re-used across European higher academic institutions. Educational content included in mEducator covers and represents the whole range of medical educational content, from traditional instructional teaching to active learning and experiential teaching/studying approaches. It spans the whole range of types, from text to exam sheets, algorithms, teaching files, computer programs (simulators or games) and interactive objects (like virtual patients and electronically traced anatomies, while it covers a variety of topics. mEducator aims to (a) examine to what extend existing standards for the description of educational material can address all the possible types of medical educational material listed above, and make respective recommendations for standards extensions; (b) examine to what extend existing standards for educational material packaging and exchange among learning management systems are adequate to support state-of-the art educational content sharing in medicine and provide respective recommendations for standards extensions; and (c) examine to what extend a recently proposed standard-based reference model for automated educational content discovery, retrieval and sharing can be employed for medical educational content delivery and sharing, and provide respective recommendations for reference model extensions. As a BNP, mEducator will attempt to compare two contemporary ways of achieving this content sharing, namely, a solution based on Web2.0 technologies, and a solution based on semantic web services. mEducator will work closely with MedBiquitous Europe standardization body to adopt and implement MedBiquitous technology standards for medical and healthcare education in order to make medical content interoperable and shareable across the European Union. For this to succeed, material is re-purposed for multilingual, multicultural use and access. Provision of the material to non-partner institutes is planned with the foreseen (sustainability) aim to invite more institutes in the distributed pool. Last but not least, mEducator will invite students, educators, and health professionals (continuing education) to evaluate its outcomes. **** Contact information **** BAMIDIS Panagiotis Aristotle University of Thessaloniki POBox 323 54124 THESSALONIKI GR Tel. +30-2310-999310 Fax. +30-2310-999263";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 4.50m";" Euro 3.60m";" ECP-2008-EDU-418006";" From 01/05/2009 to 30/04/2012";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"14";"9"

The project is committed to enhancing the learning experience of science and engineering students all over Europe.  Many universities are challenged by large numbers of students demanding access to laboratories during their training but capacity is limited especially for advanced or graduate students. Remote experiments and virtual laboratories tackle these problems: they are accessible 24 hours per day, and can be used without supervision in some cases. At the same time, they provide students with insights into how processes are controlled in today&rsquo;s industry. Within this context, Lila aims to:     * Create a technical and organizational framework for the mutual exchange       of experiments across Europe.     * Build a portal for access to virtual laboratories, remote experiments and       other media.     * Make them accessible via a retrieval system.     * Exploit them with an access control and booking system.     * Guide users with a tutoring system.     * Integrate labs into a virtual 3D-world and provide a framework for online       collaboration.     * Disseminate the network across Europe. **** Contact information **** BOEHRINGER David   GERMANY Tel.

However, an impressive abundance of high quality digital content that is available in European repositories remains largely unexploited due to a number of barriers such as: the lack of interoperability standards between repositories, the inefficiency of current content organization and metadata structures as well as multi-lingual issues. The OpenScienceResources project suggests a coordinated solution at European level in order to overcome the aforementioned barriers. To implement the OpenScienceResources vision, the consortium brings together a balanced mix of high quality science museums and science centers, pedagogues, educational technologists, metadata experts, user groups and standardization bodies. The envisaged solution consists of the following steps: a) study the state-of-the-art in metadata ontological approaches coupling them with modern social tagging and folksonomies, b) design a set of proof-of-concept; experiments to try out the different theoretical approaches that will be developed and implement them in the OpenScienceResources Portal, c) extensively validate the proposed approaches in real-life usage contexts employing the user groups represented in the consortium, e) document the whole process, disseminate the results, cluster with similar initiatives and stakeholders and, through the significant networking capacity of the OpenScienceResources consortium, work towards a pan- European digital educational content standard. **** Contact information **** FRANCHE Catherine Coudenberg 70, 5th floor Brussels BELGIUM Tel. 3226497383 Fax. 32473532096";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 5.69m";" Euro 2.60m";" ECP-2008-EDU-428045";" From 01/06/2009 to 31/05/2012";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"20";"13"

To maintain or even improve current standards, many European countries want to increase the enrollment and output of engineering studies, and they face the problem of high drop-out of engineering students. For instance, in Germany the drop-out rate sometimes goes up to 35% and one of the primary reasons is the lack of needed mathematical skills. This caused the industrial Arbeitgeberverband Gesamtmetall to raise an alarm. Drop-out rates in engineering studies are high Europe-wide. An important reason for these high rates is that engineering students are often not appropriately informed and prepared for their studies. In particular, they lack the necessary mathematical competencies. In traditional remedial courses, individual treatment of competency gaps is impossible and such courses rarely solve the problem. From our experience at universities and colleges we know the high demand for tailored remedial maths content. Existing portals for such content have a restricted amount of content which is mostly in a single language. On-line mathematical education content is available only scattered, in multiple formats, in various notations, badly searchable, in a single language rather than multi-lingual, and cannot be tailored to the learners needs. Math-Bridge aims at changing this situation and help to bridge the gap between schools and higher education in Eurpoe. It will provide multi-lingual and multi-cultural semantic access in a sustainable Pan-European learning service for remedial mathematics content that tailors to the prerequisites of the learner and her study-subject. It will bring together content from di erent European sources and o er it in a uni ed way. A Pan-European learning service for remedial mathematics is obtained by collecting appropriate learning resources, extending them with structure, metadata, maths semantics, interactivity, and multi- linguality where necessary. The extended formats of the content will make use of standards, and hence be re-usable and interoperable. For an adequate infrastructure we will adapt our semantic and multi-lingual search software, customize assessments, customize the ActiveMath learning environment to the remedy-scenario which includes speci c diagnostic means and decision making for remedy, and determine the culturally determined incoming competencies (of students who start the remedy) and the (target) competencies required for the target study subjects. Moreover, Math-Bridge will develop a process model for collaborative authoring, determine Creative Commons license for content (IPR), and adapt tool-support for collaborative authoring that respects the semantics and metadata of content. This will support collaborative production and assembly of (educational) content, which we think is a future must.The results will be usable way beyond mathematics. **** Contact information **** MELIS Erica Stuhlsatzenhausweg Geb. 3.2 3 66123 SaarbrÃ¼cken GERMANY Tel. +49 681 302 4629 Fax. +49 681 302 2235";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 3.60m";" Euro 1.80m";" ECP-2008-EDU-428046";" From 01/05/2009 to 31/01/2012";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"11";"7"
"project-ECP-2008-GEO-318004";"GS Soil: Assessment and strategic development of INSPIRE compliant Geodata-Services for European Soil Data";"**** The European Soil Strategy has enforced the link between soil information and geo-information creating the need for interoperable, accessible and harmonised soil datasets for the EU. **** Within the European Member States comprehensive soil data assets exist. Although notable amounts of soil data have already been prepared digitally, data accessibility is still extremely limited. The inter-organisational and cross-border distribution of soil data is tremendously difficult and in many cases data sets are not interoperable, neither on a technical nor on a semantic level. For the huge community of experts and citizens within the European Union soil data therefore are difficult to obtain, to understand and to use. The establishment of the soil thematic strategy and the new trans-boundary approach for protected sites management has enforced the link between soil conservation and best practice use and geo-information. This has generated the need for interoperable, accessible and harmonised datasets and the link is also addressed by the INSPIRE Directive which pursues an EU Spatial Data Infrastructure to support environmental policies. GS Soil aims at establishing a Best Practice Network focused on soil related issues, through state-of-the-art methodologies and best practice examples, in order to enhance harmonization of national datasets and improving accessibility and exploitability. Thereby it will also contribute to the INSPIRE implementation with specific reference to a cluster of data themes on nature conservation. Within the directive soil is explicitly addressed as an individual theme and besides that, soil related environmental, agricultural and forestry aspects are also addressed. Therefor the thematic focus of GS Soil is set on soil as an important parameter according to climate, land use, geology and geomorphology. At the same time soils are the basis for food production and consumer health, for the ecological and economical balance and for many other important bases of life. Considering the INSPIRE Annexes, the following soil and soil related themes will be considered: • Basic soil describing information including depth, texture, structure and organic material as described in Annex III theme Soil, • Information about soil monitoring facilities and long term observations as part of the Annex III theme Environmental Monitoring Facilities, • Information about the soil related aspects of Annex III theme Natural Risk Zones as e.g. landslides, soil erosion, soil compaction, soil organic carbon decline, salinization, acidification and soil biodiversity loss, • Soil related information of the INSPIRE Annex III theme Human Health and Safety and • Soils as primary site factor to identify protected land as part of the INSPIRE Annex I theme Protected Sites (e.g. peat land, extrazonal sites) The main objective of the GS Soil Network is to: • involve new stakeholders; • share data and best practices; • improve and stimulate exploitation and • improve re-use of information on nature conservation. **** Contact information **** SCHMALZ Reinhard Archivstr. 2 30169 HANNOVER GERMANY Tel. +49 511 120 0 Fax. +49 511 120 3399";"eContentplus Programme";"";" Euro 5.12m";" Euro 4.10m";" ECP-2008-GEO-318004";" From 01/06/2009 to 31/05/2012";" Closed";" eContentplus Programme BPN Best Practice Network ";"34";"18"

The project involves detailed description and summarising of current situation and standards, proposal, testing and implementation of spatial planning metadata profile, common data model and harmonisation procedures. The important part of project Plan4all is networking standards of spatial planning data, based on previously collected and analysed experiences and then defining common procedures and methodologies for spatial data sharing and utilisation of new cross Europe standards for spatial planning data within the EU. The focus will be not only on technical and technological aspects, but also on Digital Right Managements and other IPR issues, security of data and data models. Important part will be also models for public private data sharing, and how spatial planning data could be used for social, environmental and economical development and also for protection of citizens. On the level of economical development, the sharing will support mainly real estate business and investment across Europe. The expected results from Plan4all are European forums for SDI in spatial planning, database of best practices, analysis of best practices in term of organisation, mutualisation, harmonisation and recommendations for SDI for spatial planning. **** Contact information **** MILDORF Tomas   CZECH REPUBLIC Tel.

"project-EP-06-01-021";"TID+: TID+";"**** Enabling citizens&rsquo; initiative to eParticipation **** TID+ is aimed at governmental and non-governmental organisations that are looking for a solution to allow citizens to take the initiative in proposing and discussing new regulation. In June 2001, the Estonian government launched a public participation portal named &ldquo;Today I decide&rdquo; (known under the Estonian acronym &ldquo;TOM&rdquo;). The tool gave citizens an opportunity to propose, discuss and vote on new legislation, after which decision-makers are obliged to deliver a motivated response to the entered initiatives. This tool has proven to be a big success, with over 6.600 registered users proposing and discussing 1.021 new initiatives. It has helped citizens&rsquo; participation by allowing them to launch new ideas and to discuss them on an open forum, while guaranteeing them a concise answer from the decisionmaking level. Five years of experience with this tool have made clear that it can be a meaningful instrument for all governments and public bodies throughout the European Union. The present project, TID+, aims to disseminate the tool and the experiences with it to interested parties in the EU. It will re-evaluate and ameliorate the present solution, develop comprehensive documentation on how it can be used optimally, and make it available free for non-commercial use to all interested actors as a tool to increase citizens&rsquo; participation. The TID+ project provides an easy solution - a free system that allows citizens to send in ideas, discuss them and express support for other ideas through voting.

On the basis of an ontological characterisation of legal language DALOS - Drafting Legislation with Ontology-based Support Project intends to provide law-makers and European citizens with linguistic and knowledge management tools to be used respectively in the phase of legislative drafting and in the retrieval procedures.  The results of the project consist in improving the quality of legislation, in enhancing the terminological coherence of legislative texts in multilingual context and in supporting with ontological knowledge the debate concerning the interpretation and implementation of legislative rules as well as democratic participation.     **** Contact information **** TISCORNIA Daniela Via de Barucci 20 50127 FIRENZE IT Tel. +39 0554399620 Fax. +39 0554399605";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.39m";" Euro 0.28m";" EP-06-01-024";" From 01/01/2007 to ";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"9";"4"

"project-EP-07-01-008";"IDEAL-EU: IDEAL-EU";"**** Social networking to save the planet **** jpg> Almost everyone has an opinion on climate change and how best to address the world&rsquo;s mounting environmental problems. Until now, however, few have had an effective way to make their voices heard. Soon citizens of three European regions will have the chance to participate in political debates over climate change and communicate with policy-makers through an internet site being deployed by the IDEAL-EU project. The project partners will launch a debating and voting platform targeting residents of Tuscany in Italy, Catalonia in Spain and Poitou-Charentes in France. The regional administrations of each of the three regions are partners in the project. **** Broadening the climate change debate **** The platform will allow citizens to access European, national and regional policy debates on climate change, share their opinions and send recommendations to policy-makers. Users can launch themes for discussion using a blog-like component, upload their own videos and photos and comment on other users&rsquo; opinions, while contributions from policy-makers will be given added prominence. A voting component will give users the ability to make their thoughts known on any climate change issue &ndash; from how best to cut CO2 emissions, to how to deal with the consequences of rising sea levels. The project partners hope to support the European Parliament&rsquo;s efforts to raise awareness about climate change and to promote environmentally friendly initiatives at the local, regional and national, as well as EU levels. **** High-tech town meeting **** Through a variety of promotional activities involving local administrations, schools and non-governmental organisations, the team aims to build up a user- base of between three and five thousand people in each of the three regions. Many of the participants will then be invited to attend the electronic &lsquo;town meeting&rsquo;. The work of the project team will come to a head on 15 November 2008 when they plan to meet with the participants from all three regions involved in the trials attending in person or participating via the internet. The Italian, French and Catalan participants will hold both real and virtual roundtable discussions assisted by translators. Participants will vote on their conclusions at the end. **** Helping to promote e-participation **** Once they have tested the system with the debates on climate change, the project partners then hope the platform and methodology will be used by other local and regional authorities across Europe as a way to boost citizen participation in policy-making. By using new information technologies to encourage e-participation, the team hopes more people will have a say in debates and decisions affecting them, be it environmental policy, town planning or taxation. The goal of the partners is to perfect a platform that can be distributed on a CD and deployed easily in a matter of hours by public administrations anywhere. **** Contact information **** MARCOTULLI Angelo Via Cavour 18 50129 Florence Italy Tel. + 39 055 4383095 Fax. +39 055 4383195";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.73m";" Euro 0.55m";" EP-07-01-008";" From 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"6";"5"
"project-EP-07-01-012";"E-COMMITTEE: E-COMMITTEE";"**** Encouraging citizens to participate **** [Parliament] Through technology developed in Europe, EU citizens will get the chance to have closer contact with &ndash; and more influence on &ndash; their representatives at the European Parliament. The eCommittee project, part of the EU eParticipation initiative, will gather suggestions and questions from citizens and interested organisations from ten EU countries. The questions will be put to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) serving on committees looking at climate change and other environmental issues. Between now and 2010 the project will target six major committee sessions for citizen participation. If MEPs respond positively to the citizen input, and react to it, the pilot scheme could pave the way for a fully functioning system that allows  people to have more direct input into all legislation. **** Using existing technology **** In the initial stages, the project team concentrated on making sure the technical infrastructure was in place to allow the proposed participation to go ahead. The four main project partners have also been appointing national moderators in each of the ten targeted EU Member States. The project will use web-conferencing technology combined with the European Parliament&rsquo;s new video and audio streaming services. Slovenia-based project partner Novitech will look after the technical side of the project, provide online collaborative tools, and ensure consistent content service before, during and after committee sessions. **** Citizens from ten countries **** German partner Forum Umwelt und Entwicklung has been identifying and appointing national moderators and inviting concerned stakeholders from Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom to participate. Environmental expertise is provided by the Belgium-based Climate Action Network, while the Association of Accredited Lobbyists to the European Parliament will handle liasing with MEPs and communicating with the public. The proposed structure the partners are putting in place will allow environmental non-governmental organisations, business federations, labour organisations, climate researchers, student organisations and other bodies interested in climate change to feed their input to their national moderators. Input from individual citizens will also be encouraged. The project planners aim to attract about 200 active citizen participants or an average of ten from each country. **** MEPs must agree **** The participants will be kept informed of all the relevant news and events relating to climate change and the environment via the project&rsquo;s website, which also features a discussion forum. If the majority of MEPs on the European Parliament&rsquo;s Environment Committee and the Temporary Climate Change Committee agree, the sessions the project has chosen to cover will be accessible live via the eCommittee communications architecture. Two master moderators will be present at the committee sessions and will relay questions and comments to the MEPs. Whether this will happen while the MEPs are meeting, or before or after sessions, remains to be decided. It is uncertain how MEPs and the public will react to the new concept. However, if it is a success, then the service could lead to more participation in the pan-European democratic process. **** Contact information **** TOTH Attila Moyzesova 58 04001 Kosice Slovakia Tel. +421-55-3274491 Fax. +421-55-6221043";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.60m";" Euro 0.45m";" EP-07-01-012";" From 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"4";"3"

It will involve both civil society and public institutions in a shared environment that is moderated and managed by the Local Authority. CitizenScape will integrate and test innovative ICT tools to involve citizens in the implementation of EU environmental legislation at a local level. It will define the precise conditions and will be based on citizens' own proposals for participation in major EU issues. It will also address the specific barriers to be overcome for deployment.   Based on the successful Public-i webcast methodology the project seeks to create a democratic pathway by attracting and recruiting citizens to use the Web 2.0 style space of CitizenScape and then migrating them to more formal online democratic tools (such as petitioning).  These formal tools will be the means to access the decision makers &ndash; in this case Local Councillors. CitizenScape will be a flexible online space that will blend and integrate social networking and other Web 2.0 technologies with more formal online democratic tools. The Citizen eParticipation methodology will create an accessible and inclusive model for engaging citizens: it will ensure that CitizenScape implementations not only have effective technologies but also the effective offline recruitment activities and support to guarantee that the CitizenScapes are vibrant and active democratic centres. **** Contact information **** O'FLAHERTY John Surapule House, Lonsdale Road, National Technology Park Limerick Ireland Tel. +353 61 334699 Fax. +353 61 338500";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.76m";" Euro 0.57m";" EP-07-01-016";" From 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"6";"4"

Users will be able to introduce subjects for online debate, to relate existing content to legislative information and related topics, and also to upload support material, such as videos, that help to explain or refine aspects of the deliberation. It will also be possible to retrieve content and comment on specific issues through specially adapted and easy to use interfaces, for example a roadmap to take the user through the various stages and structure of a legal act, thus enabling users to better understand, and comment on specific parts. The main objective of FEED is to support public deliberation and consultation by providing users with seamless access to existing content on environmental and energy issues. The end result should be better quality policy at the European level. In the process FEED builds trust and facilitates acceptance of policy by giving NGOs, citizens and businesses the means to supervise government and policy implementation, thus balancing the influence of lobbying organisations. Finally, it widens the responsibility for policy-making, and the ownership of resulting policy, by fostering active citizenship.  **** Contact information **** PSARRAS John Heroon Polytechneiou str. 9 15780 Athens Greece Tel. +30-210-7723551 Fax. +30-210-7723550";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.95m";" Euro 0.71m";" EP-07-01-032";" From 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"6";"4"
"project-EP-07-01-034";"VOICE: VOICE";"**** Giving citizens a voice in EU policy-making **** [VoicE] Copyright: VoicE project Brussels is often accused of being a &lsquo;black box&rsquo; that produces legislation affecting all EU citizens but which is slow to listen to their demands. A new project aims to increase transparency and public participation in EU policy-making. The team working on the VoicE project are developing an internet platform that will not only make for ordinary people to find out about and understand EU laws, procedures and debates, but will also let them have a say in how policy is decided. The aim is to bring public policy-making into the Web 2.0 era of online information sharing, collaboration and interactivity in order to let everyone exchange ideas and give their opinion on issues that affect them. The project will make e-participation &ndash; i.e. using new technologies to get people involved in politics &ndash; a reality. The project partners are using Gov2DemOSS, a state-of-the-art open source content management system, to provide the technological backbone of the system. **** Make policy understandable... **** During the first phase, the partners are using the platform to host clear and straightforward information about EU legislation so that anyone can understand an important policy issue in just ten minutes. Clear and accessible information not only increases political transparency but also helps overcome one of the factors that has hampered participatory politics &ndash; citizens&rsquo; reluctance to read numerous long documents written in a complicated way. **** … then let citizens have a say **** The platform then offers a means for citizens to contribute their own ideas to debates about the legislation and to get in contact directly with their local Member of the European Parliament (MEP). The project team are focusing on using the platform at a regional level to ensure politics remains close to citizens, using their MEPs in order to be able to participate in Brussels decision-making. MEPs, in turn, are better able to understand and respond to the demands of their constituents if the feedback they receive is provided in a structured and clear manner. **** Tests in Germany and Spain **** A prototype of the platform will be tested initially in the regions of Baden- Württemberg in Germany and in Valencia in Spain. For the trials, the team is focusing its work on improving citizen input in debates about consumer protection legislation. Product labelling, for example, is currently a hot topic in Brussels. Many citizens could be expected to have ideas, complaints and concerns that they would like to share with their MEPs about the quality of toys or the ingredients in food, for example. By logging in to their local e-participation platform they would be able to make their thoughts known, bringing them a step closer to being on an equal footing with lobbyists and special interest groups. **** Contact information **** SCHEPERS Johanna BreitscheidstraÃe 4 70174 Stuttgart Germany Tel. +49-711-90715-329 Fax. +49-711-90715-350";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.81m";" Euro 0.61m";" EP-07-01-034";" From 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"9";"3"
"project-EP-07-01-035";"DEMOS@WORK: DEMOS@WORK";"**** Enable European-wide discussion between elected representatives and civil society **** The war on smoking is about to be stepped up in Europe. An innovative web portal will allow EU citizens to provide direct feedback on smoking issues to European parliamentarians. One of several projects falling under the EU&rsquo;s eParticipation initiative, the Demos@Work project will tap into anti-smoking sentiment for a test run in participatory democracy. Depending on how the project pans out, it could lead to a broader involvement of ordinary people in the legislative process. The project will make full use of the latest Web 2.0 technologies to create a web portal that will allow real-time exchanges of information and ideas between citizens and some of their elected representatives. **** Interaction with legislators **** It will also have a mobile platform that will allow both citizens and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to access the project&rsquo;s services and applications and interact with each other. The portal will be created through the customisation of two open-source platforms. One was developed by a completed EU-funded project and the other by a non-profit, non-governmental organisation (NGO). Project eRepresentative created a virtual desktop to provide mobile support to elected representatives. It worked with legislators, civil servants and other stakeholders in the European Parliament. The other platform is Gov2DemOSS, which is a generic, informative and collaborative e-participation platform that claims to be the most advanced of its kind. The platform provides a user-friendly channel for elected officials to interact directly with their constituents, and vice versa. **** Keeping up to date **** The virtual desktop gives officials the opportunity to keep constituents abreast of news and upcoming events, and to gauge public opinion by posting polls and topics for deliberation. Registered citizen users can take part in discussion forums, tell their own stories in blogs, view topics under discussion, access related documents and vote in the polls. The generic nature of both platforms means that the software developed for them can be extensively customised to suit the requirements of Demos@Work. On one level, the project is about getting citizens involved in all discussions and decisions that are part of the EU&rsquo;s fight against smoking. On another, it is a testbed for addressing the issue of citizen disengagement from the decision-making processes, increasing the level of awareness of parliamentary activities among citizens and leveraging existing information and communications technology (ICT) assets. **** Improving dialogue **** The partners in the project anticipate Demos@Work will improve the level of dialogue between regional and national representatives, the European Parliament and citizens, while using and testing different forms and methods of civic engagement. Like other eParticipation projects, Demos@Work will rely heavily on the latest in ICT to try and bring about a fundamental change in the way traditional democratic societies, in particular the EU and its Member States, engage both leaders and citizens. **** Contact information **** PÃREZ ORTEGA MarÃ­a C/ Serrano Galvache, Edificio Encina, planta 7 56 28033 Madrid Spain Tel. +32 10 237 364 Fax. +32 10 237 315";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.95m";" Euro 0.71m";" EP-07-01-035";" From 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"6";"3"
"project-EP-07-01-039";"VEP: VEP";"**** Participating in a virtual European Parliament **** The concept of using the internet to encourage EU citizens to participate in the European Parliament is rapidly growing. Now attempts are being made to draw the younger generation into the debate via the technologies they use on a daily basis. The Virtual European Parliament (VEP) project, which runs from early 2008 to the end of 2009, aims to integrate young citizens into the decision-making process of the European Parliament. The project team hopes to attract a minimum of 600 young participants from three regions: Lulea in the far north of Sweden, Barcelona in Spain and Flanders in Belgium. The participants, many of whom are expected to be university students, will be able to access information on the Parliamentary agenda via the VEP portal, which the project partners are creating. **** Voting via mobile phone **** Using the latest Web 2.0 technologies, participants will be able to exchange ideas with others in real time, collaboratively write reports on specific topics, and be asked for their opinions via mobile voting and surveying. Web 2.0 technologies enhance creativity, information sharing and collaboration among users and underpin social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook. An international support office set up by the project will act as moderator and control the quality of all VEP activities. The staff will also ensure that activities in the VEP are synchronised with the activities of the real European Parliament and that they follow the decision-making process. In June 2008, the project partners were in the process of creating a system called the &lsquo;Virtual European Parliament Framework&rsquo;. The system consists of Web 2.0-based technology and a mobile community services platform. The framework will be used for voting, surveying participants&rsquo; views, and enabling mobile access to VEP activities. **** Feedback to refine portal **** During the course of the trial, the project will gather feedback from participants on an ongoing basis regarding both the technologies they use, and the added value they feel they get from the VEP framework and activities. This information will be used to refine the portal and the virtual activities as the project progresses. The ultimate aim is to create a virtual public room for a debate between citizens and decision-makers, specifically Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), several of whom will be directly involved with the project. **** Conferencing goes mega **** The project will employ some of the latest technologies and techniques, including the use of video-conferencing software. The software allows the holding of video-conferencing sessions featuring between 100 and 400 participants. Web 2.0 technology, including blogging, wikis, tagging, interactive features, and content gathering, will be important features of the website. The project team will also use mobile technology linked to the rest of the software tools to allow the young participants full access via their mobile phones. How the project will be received remains to be seen, but it could be a step in the right direction to get young people more interested and involved in the EU political process. **** Contact information **** DE COLVENAER Mark Keppische Steenweg 297/3 B-3500 Hasselt Belgium Tel. +32 476 460859 Fax. +32 11 717 889";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.95m";" Euro 0.71m";" EP-07-01-039";" From 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"5";"3"

It will use highly integrated, state-of-the-art Argument Visualisation techniques to make the impact of complex EU environmental legislation on climate change more accessible and easy to understand for citizens, special interest groups and decision makers alike. WAVE will deploy Debategraph (www.debategraph.org), an innovative argument visualisation platform, in a multi-lingual, cross border context. WAVEwill target cross-border discussions on drafted and implemented legislation. These discussions will be facilitated on Debategraph so as to understand the impact of the proposed and implemented legislation. WAVE will feed back its results to MEPs and MPs that have affiliated with the project in order to ultimately join up with and inform at least three governments-the national governments of the three trial sites - UK, France and Lithuania. The main objectives of WAVE are:     * Engage a broad range of citizens in trials and test the effectiveness of       argument visualization tools in helping citizens from a variety of       countries and demographics to better understand complex issues generally     * Measure whether and under what conditions these tools can have specific       impact on one of the most important and popular legislative agendas       facing Europe (environment). **** Contact information **** TARABANIS KONSTANTINOS 156, Egnatia Street 54 006 Thessaloniki GREECE Tel. +302310891578 Fax. +302310891501";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.92m";" Euro 0.69m";" EP-08-01-002";" From 01/02/2009 to 31/01/2011";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART eParticipation ";"8";"6"

OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION  The project will support citizens and local actors in identifying environmental problems that need to be solved in the French Riviera, Valencia and Ionian Islands regions as well as finding ways to solve these problems. The project will involve citizens, representatives of NGOs and public authorities and will make use of geographic information systems. The platform features interactive documents that link specific sections of text to specific features on maps. The application can be used: - for land-use planning; - to identify environmental problems and hazards regarding, for example, air pollution, water resources, waste water, chemical &amp; fuel dumps, waste, and so on; - to exploit ordinary citizens' local knowledge in order to identify environmental problems and hazards and make proposals for solutions; - to enable those affected as well as environmental NGOs to comment on proposals for projects affecting the environment or plans and programmes relating to the environment. Local people will be invited to register their views about particular issues by placing flags with written comments on specific locations on a map. An end-user will be able to view a map of the area he/she is interested in, perform zoom and pan operations to assist in visualisation and navigation, ask questions such as what is this building? and what is this road? (spatial queries) and then make suggestions about specific features identified on the map (attribute input). EXPECTED RESULTS Our trial project will qualitatively improve the level of interaction between relevant actors and thus contribute to the establishment of a &ldquo;public sphere&rdquo; concerning EU topics with a regional focus. The exchange of information will promote cross-border cooperation as well as mutual understanding between the countries involved in the project. Moreover, the project will support stakeholders from the French Riviera, Valencia and Ionian regions to consult each other on all major plans and strategies under consideration that are likely to have a significant environmental impact across borders. The project provides an open-source software solution and methodology to help local decision-makers from the above-mentioned regions to improve the quality, legitimacy and transparency of their policies for citizens. Simultaneously, citizens will be provided with a means to become more familiar with and involved in the functioning of democratic decision-making and to monitor the implementation of EU environmental law in these regions. Citizens will have the opportunity to express their concerns in matters affecting them. Participation will help to create more informed local, regional and national government decision-making by incorporating diverse opinions, values and ideas and benefiting from direct, immediate knowledge of the environmental conditions from the community and citizens. Public involvement will improve the quality of decision-making, raise citizen awareness of environmental issues and increase public understanding of the decision-making process. It will also help to build broad-based consensus for environmental programmes and more support for their implementation.  **** Contact information **** PEREZ ORTEGA Maria Technologielaan 11 - 010 3001 Heverlee (Leuven) BE Tel. +32(0)16 38 11 11 Fax. +32(0)16 38 11 00";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.80m";" Euro 0.60m";" EP-08-01-005";" From 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2010";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"7";"4"
"project-EP-08-01-009";"EUROPETITION: EUROPETITION";"**** eParticipation through Petitioning in Europe **** A traditional way for the general public to influence decision-making is by organising a petition. Online petition systems have been introduced in some EU Member States both at National and increasingly local levels in order to make it easier to gather signatures from a wider audience. The European Parliament Petitions Committee has an active online petition submission website and the Lisbon Treaty introduces Citizens&rsquo; Initiatives, whereby citizens will be able to call on the Commission to bring forward new policy proposals if they have the support of 1 million people from a significant number of EU Member States.  Petitioning is a simple yet effective tool that provides an excellent first step for citizens who want to engage with their Local Council, National and European Parliaments. EuroPetition is providing such as a service. EuroPetition is a service mediated by Local Authorities providing citizen engagement locally and distributed interaction with National Petitioning initiatives, the European Parliament&rsquo;s Petitions Committee and the Commission&rsquo;s Citizens Initiative online procedures using a proven open- source UK ePetitions service and experience, and building on innovative and state-of-the-art Web 2.0 applications. The project will pilot trial the coordination and submission of cross-border and pan-European &ldquo;EuroPetitions&rdquo; from 5 Regional Clusters in Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and UK , involving 16 Local Authorities and over 6.7 million citizens across the EU. The project aims to create an open, simple and scalable process which will build local support for petitions and then to migrate these to other territories to achieve cross-border and ultimately pan- European support. The service will enable citizens to launch and manage petitions on specific issues, with on-line discussions either on a local basis or through Regional Clusters leading to a multilingual dialogue to gain cross-border support on a single issue, while retaining the interaction between the citizen and their local, national and EU authorities. EuroPetition will provide simple jargon buster facilities to support citizens in understanding the issues during the discussions and in launching a petition. It will include explanatory videos and content to explain the process and purpose of petitioning to EU citizens, and have embedded workflow support for the petitioner in &lsquo;marketing&rsquo; their petition as well as providing viral tools (such as Facebook widgets) to help increase participation and signing across regions. As the EuroPetition service will be used in a number of cross-border decision- making cases it will be relevant in promoting eParticipation not only in the context of the European Parliament and Commission but also in many legislative and decision-making processes at Local, National and European levels. **** Contact information **** O'FLAHERTY John The National Microelectronics Applications Centre Ltd, Lonsdale Road, National Technology Park N/A Limerick Ireland Tel. +353-61-334699 Fax. +353-61-338500";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 1.00m";" Euro 0.75m";" EP-08-01-009";" From 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2010";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART ";"8";"6"
"project-EP-08-01-011";"HUWY: HUWY";"**** Hub Websites for Youth Participation **** jpg> The HUWY (Hub Websites for Youth Participation) project aims to get young people talking about policies and laws which affect the Internet and channel this to people in governments and parliaments, working on these policies. Young people choose the topics and questions, host the discussions on their web pages and post the results on Hub websites (Hubs) provided by the project. The topics HUWY will focus on are: • Cyberbullying • Child abuse and child safety • Freedom of speech and censorship • ID theft, privacy and phishing • Security (identity, hacking, buying and selling on the internet) • File-sharing/copyright The above list is a summary of themes, which vary a little between the 4 pilot countries: Estonia, Germany, Republic of Ireland and UK. HUWY also supports an open theme for young people to create their own topics.  The HUWY project addresses a number of challenges: 1. Getting informed input from young people 2. Creating useful results for policy-makers 3. Piloting a distributed discussion The HUWY project aims to involve at least 20 youth groups in each pilot country. The memberships of youth organisations vary dramatically, between a few friends to up half a million, for networks in the larger pilot countries. We aim to involve about 20 people from each organisation. **** Contact information **** TAYLOR-SMITH Ella International Teledemocracy Centre, NAPIER UNIVERSITY, 10, COLINTON ROAD EH10 5DT Edinburgh UNITED KINGDOM Tel. +44 131 455 2545 Fax. +44 131 455 2582";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 0.67m";" Euro 0.50m";" EP-08-01-011";" From 01/01/2009 to 31/01/2011";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART eParticipation ";"10";"4"

The three S... VoiceS is a project that integrates Semantics, Social Software and Serious Games into eParticipation. ...Semantics In the framework of VoiceS, the existing VoicE platform will be complemented by a semantic ontology. This enables • intelligent search instead of keyword based search • query answering instead of information retrieval • exchange of documents between different domains with ontology mapping, and • definition or personalized views to the documents. ...Serious games If citizens have limited knowledge or understanding of  the complex system of EU decision-making and its mechanisms, they can broaden their knowledge by playing the serious game on the VoiceS platform. This game lets citizens explore the realms of EU legislation in a playful, interactive and entertaining manner. By switching into the position of an MEP, a lobbyist or a Council member, the player will go through the whole legislative process (e.g. of the Telecommunications directive (2007/0248 COD)) and be constantly confronted with political challenges. Depending on which character he is in the game, he will have to take decisions and bear the consequences in the game. This way, not only the EU legislative process, but also the legislative issue at hand and the difficulties decision-makers are facing, become transparent and comprehensible for the citizens. ...Social networks For the VoicE project, accounts on various social networks (facebook, myspace, linkedin) will be created. Thus the awareness and usage of the platform will be increased among the general public. Toolkit Apart from new functions, VoiceS will also deliver services to help other regions setting up similar initiatives of their own.  This will happen via a Toolkit for Regional eParticipation initiatives which will be delivered at the end of the project runtime (i.e. end 2010). The toolkit will comprise the results of the eParticipation projects VoicE and voiceS as well as a &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; section and other tools which are supposed to help other regions in implementing similar eParticipation initiatives. Thus, a sustainable impact of the eParticipation projects VoicE and VoiceS is ensured and an added value is generated Target Group • Citizens from Baden-Württemberg and Valencia • Members of the European Parliament/Committee of the Regions linked to Baden- Württemberg and the Valencia Region • Representatives from regional administrative bodies • Representatives from Brussels-based organisations with links to region • Citizens from other European regions are of course also welcome to join the platform **** Contact information **** SCHEPERS Johanna Breitscheidstr. 4 70174 Stuttgart Germany Tel. +49 711 90715 329 Fax. +49 711 90715 350";"eParticipation";"";" Euro 1.00m";" Euro 0.75m";" EP-08-01-029";" From 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2010";" Closed";" eParticipation EPART eParticipation ";"11";"5"

The certification scheme is based on a German state privacy seal awarded by the Independent Centre for Privacy Protection Schleswig-Holstein. EuroPriSe will offer a transparent procedure to grant the European Privacy Seal as well as a procedure to admit European Privacy Seal experts and accredit certification bodies throughout Europe. The public evaluation report especially provided and published for each certified product offers benchmarks to compare competing products. The seal visualizes that a product has been checked and approved by an independent privacy organisation and thus indicates a trustworthy product fostering consumer protection, civil rights and acceptance of privacy by marketing mechanisms. The market validation project will provide a unique selling preposition for European IT business. The European Privacy Seal will increase market transparency for privacy relevant products leading to an enlargement of the market for Privacy Enhancing Technologies and finally an increase of trust in IT. The market validation of EuroPriSe bears estimated total investment costs for the partners of 2 mill. EUR. The eTen program will support EuroPriSe over a period of 18 month with 1,3 mill. EUR.

As technology is abundant and knowledge becomes a commodity, clients want new performances, sustainable solutions, at affordable prices. Itï¿½s a common agreed fact that industrial property databases are legal and technical instruments of a considerable usefulness. The importance of the public information there contained transcends a simple intellectual property rights protection. Resorting to the information contained in public industrial databases and archives, itï¿½s possible to get a sound idea of the state-of-the-art regarding certain technology, product or service. Such databases are instruments of mandatory check in any innovation process and an important source of information for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), industrial companies, researchers and academics. Despite the easiness and current level of accessibility, the usefulness of the information was, until now, limited to the suppression of very simple needs, mainly achievable through a simple query. This is due, to some extent, to the way the information is offered: in a raw state, merely exposed. The INNOVALL now presents an innovative service based on a proven technology, developed throughout an eContent feasibility study , capable of rendering new use to this source of information, transforming a simple query into a powerful tool for innovation, capable of efficiently search, extract and process relevant knowledge from public industrial property databases, and help users to gain a more accurate positioning regarding the state-of-the-art and reduce the risk of duplicative innovation investments.

In Better Breathing ICT tools will be make it possible to monitor the chronic patient at home (eCare) as well as train and rehabilitate the patient (eRehabilitation). This will reduce the cost and inconvenience of transporting severely sick people from their home to the training facilities and will give them a better quality of life. In addition, Better Breathing will set up an online facility (ePatient Community) where COPD patients can communicate with other COPD patients by using the eCare device or a eProfessional Community where professionals can meet and exchange experiences. In addition, an eLearning aspect will be added to the Better Breathing services as a way of creating an educational service for patients that will instruct them how to tackle their disease. This service combined with the ePatient Community will support the COPD patients and their social activities, improve their quality of life and give the patients the opportunity to exchange experiences and share ways of coping with living with COPD. The objective of Better Breathing will be met when the services have been market validated at four sites in Europe and after the project ends, the services will be ready for deployment not only in the participating regions but also in other European countries.

"project-ETEN-046229";"EuroMuse: EuroMuse.net";"euromuse.net is a public online service that currently provides multilingual information on temporary exhibitions of art and cultural history organised by more than 150 museums from 17 EU countries. euromuse.net provides the participating institutions with a collective web presence and thus increased visibility by providing the public with a ï¿½one-stopï¿½ tool to the greatest exhibitions in Europe. The current project will initially deploy the existing service, to develop a wider European data-collection based on public sector information to be re-used by different actors in the cultural and tourism fields. Cooperation with museums can help tourism professionals to make better use of the content, activities and services specific to museums, while museums can profit from the communication and distribution channels of the tourism organisations. European tourism depends heavily on the cultural heritage since most of the tourists in Europe enjoy the consumption of cultural goods. It is one of the main driving forces to spend time and money in Europe. However, it is not easy for tourism organisation to get access to data from this sector, especially from museums. They usually have their local websites but there is no way how to access this data. With the Harmonise technology, provided by ECCA, it is possible to bridge this gap and make information from European museums available for tourism players in a machine-readable way. Given this shared interests, the overall objective consists of creating a common service targeting museum and tourism professionals, for exchanging information and services.

GuideStar systems enable organisations to communicate their work effectively and easily to national and international audiences. The information provided by a GuideStar system has a large and varied audience: Grantmakers and individual donors can identify organizations whose work matches their own values and objectives. Regulators can identify, track and compare CSOs and promote improved reporting and best practices. A GuideStar system will also help streamline the acquisition of this information whilst reducing the reporting burden for CSOs. Researchers and policy makers can track trends in philanthropy and CSO services and build a core database of national civil society statistical analysis and understanding. Third Party Service Providers, such as online giving systems and accreditation agencies value GuideStar information as it helps them identify and compare CSOs and supports the growth of and public confidence in philanthropy. For CSOs, a GuideStar system increases their visibility, establishes their transparency and encourages accountability. Information on CSOs will come from a variety of sources across the participating countries, including existing databases and any available public documents. In addition, CSOs will have the opportunity to report directly to each system via an online reporting form. This open and inclusive network will give all CSOs, regardless of size, the opportunity to promote their work via the Internet.

This Phase B initial deployment will extend the existing implementations and add new countries to enable (unplanned) health care access for European citizens who provide evidence of entitlement in any 305 service sites (566 service points) across the participating countries. This can be via an eye readable EHIC, or a national health insurance electronic card, or via certain National e-ID chip card issued by the responsible government authorities of the participating partners. An online verification provides assurance to support acceptance procedures for both health insurances and health care providers. Using the NETC@RDS application and an OCR or SCR, healthcare facility staff read administrative data from the EHIC or national health insurance card of a European citizen requiring (non-planned) healthcare. Eligibility is then verified within a few seconds by checking the administrative data via two NETC@RDS portals against the database of the relevant health insurance authority. The electronic data set is processed and used as a proof of entitlement and guarantee of cross-border reimbursement. A transaction ID is also logged on the servers. These can be accessed by staff from involved insurance and cross border clearing institutions for specific audit cases, e.g. to clarify inconsistencies.

Early detection of associations between biomarkers, genes, nutrition and medication is offered by the existing system and result in earlier, more effective and simpler interventions that are usually based on nutritional and exercise modifications rather than medication. Increased emphasis is placed on preventative healthcare and delaying the onset of chronic complex diseases such as type II Diabetes and CVD. These diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, the former immutable but the latter amenable to modification with the aim of prevention. The service will screen pre-symptomatic, higher risk patients (e.g. hypertensive), and will identify through genetics and environmental analysis the preventative interventions to reduce risk factor levels, patients will be given diet/lifestyle advice and will be prescribed suitable medication where appropriate.

"project-ETEN-046321";"InLOT: In the Lab of Tomorrow";"The project In the Lab of Tomorrow (InLoT) aims at investigating the feasibility of a successful and innovative service in science teaching as a business case, whereby every day activities are effectively associated with scientific enquiry and experimentation. The purpose of the InLoT service is to deepen the science learners' understanding of scientific concepts involved in the activities, strengthen their appreciation of scientific process, and provide science education to diverse populations of future citizens, in forms that will be compatible with many learning contexts. In perspective, the InLoT Service actively supports lifelong science learning, as it sets the foundations on which all children, not only those with a pro-science orientation but importantly also those who are typically less accessed by traditional science education practices (e.g. girls, low achievers, etc.), will build their own understanding of science and the world, and later on, as adults, will pursue a personal and professional life informed by the principles of scientific inquiry and the scientific method. The wider consequences of such a change in Europeans' stance towards science are obvious, ranging from more scientific careers and enhanced employability thanks to mastering some of the core key skills, to more equity and the inclusion of all (women and men, the arts- oriented and the science-oriented) in the scientifically aware, open Information Society that EU strives to build in Europe. The work in the framework of the project will be based on three main axes, a) the utilisation of advanced technologies for connecting the curriculum based activities with everyday life, b) the significance of science education and the development of scientific literate citizens and c) the interoperability and standardization of the developed learning materials in order their use to be exploited in other schools or in other subjects. **** Contact information **** MARTIN RUBIO David   GREECE Tel. 0030 210 9209300 Fax. 0030 210 9209345";"eTen";" T4 - eLearning";" Euro 1.67m";" Euro 1.00m";" ETEN-046321";" From 01/06/2007 to 30/11/2008";" Closed";" eTen MV eTen Market Validation ";"6";"3"

It promotes standards, best practices and guidelines for digitisation that were originally proposed by the National Representatives Group, appointed by the Member States to implement the Lund Principles defined in Lund, Sweden, in 2001. It also follows up on ideas developed in the IST-funded MINERVA and MinervaPLUS projects. MICHAEL eases cross-research and enquiries, but does not directly provide copyrighted material. For example, if a user is looking for the Mona Lisa, he will get a description of collections that include images of it. MICHAEL provides the link to those collections. The current MICHAEL service already includes multilingual online material coming from more than 3000 British, French and Italian collections, presenting catalogue information describing archaeological sites, books, manuscripts, buildings, paintings, or sculptures present in European museums, archives and libraries. Its open source software is available for improvements and customisations to any new country interested in joining the network. The target audience includes students and researchers, who find MICHAEL attractive because of its wide scope, its powerful search and retrieval functionality and the enormous body of rich cultural content that it makes available. Browsers and potential tourists are attracted to it by the easy web- based user interface, by the availability to find cultural information based on the location of the original material and by the aesthetic beauty of the material presented. MICHAEL has been acknowledged as one of the two pillars of the future European Digital Library, together with the TEL project, run by the Conference of the European National Libraries.

They are dealing with critical issues of technical, semantic and workflow interoperability almost exclusively at the regional or national level. These developments threaten to hamper the further development of a European market in e-health applications and cross-border services. Building upon the activities in MSs, the results of European RTD, and learning from international efforts, i2-Health reviews the possible scenarios to accelerate the deployment of interoperable e-health infrastructures and applications for trans-European use. The main objectives of i2-Health are the following:     * identify interoperability and connectivity issues and priorities,       barriers and gaps, and solution approaches,     * focus on fundamental interoperability issues (like identification of       actors, organisations, adequate measures to achieve interoperability,       integration tests and certification)     * analyse similarly key topics relating to e-prescription and messaging     * develop a roadmap and concrete projects involving all relevant actors -       guided by an open discussion process amongst Member State Health       Authorities.     * Analyse and compare Open Methods of Coordination by the Commission to       help Member States achieve interoperability of their national/regional       health care management systems. The I2-Health project helps encouraging the use of ICT application for the integration of healthcare delivery across Europe. This Support Action is composed of two lead partners; one expert company in Healthcare and telecom management from Germany and the other being an association from Belgium representing most MS healthcare governmental and expert views. They are complemented by three research institutions from Germany, Ireland and Slovakia. In addition to the above objectives i2-Health is looking at concrete needed actions that could translate into projects which will involve different actors in healthcare. Allowing for patient mobility and cross-border medical care is a key EU policy priority and one focus of the e-Health Action Plan. Identifying needs, gaps and next steps will help to realise concrete solutions to reach these goals. Thus the project will impact on and contribute towards pan-European, patient centred seamless health service processes, equal access for all, and a greater efficiency of health systems. Interoperability will allow more effective health services to be delivered wherever citizens are and wherever they may have come from in Europe.";"eTen";" T2 - eHealth";" Euro 0.38m";" Euro 0.36m";" ETEN-517476";" From 01/02/2005 to 30/04/2007";" Closed";" eTen SA eTen Support Action ";"4";"3"

Collectively, the organisations have operated for 38 years in online safety; all working to make the internet a better environment, mirroring the conclusions of Professor Tanya Byron in her report to UK Government, by reducing availability (of illegal content), restricting access (where appropriate) and increasing resilience (through education, awareness and empowerment). UK Awareness Centre : Childnet International and SWGfL Childnet (www.childnet.com) is a children&rsquo;s charity, established in 1995, with the mission to help make the internet a great and safe place for children. It works in the area of policy, and is a UKCCIS member and is on Facebook&rsquo;s Safety Advisory Board for example, and also in the area of Education.  Childnet has a number of key roles in the new Safer Internet Centre to include organising Safer Internet Day in the UK, alongside developing a suite of new resources.  These resources will include information for parents on Games and Gaming, a technology briefing for parents, resources for teaching at Foundation stage, resources for older teenagers, and conversation starters for parents. The South West Grid for Learning (www.swgfl.org.uk)  is a not for profit, charitable trust company, funded by 15 Local Authorities across the South West of England, which provides schools and educational establishments throughout the South West of England with safe broadband internet connectivity and broadband-enabled learning resources while also offering  professionals, parents and children with advice, resources and support in using the internet safely across the wider UK.  SWGfL is contributing to the Awareness Centre, specifically by extending 360 degree safe (online e safety self review tool, www.360safe.org.uk) and e Safety Live (a round of ground breaking conference and seminar programmes www.esafetylive.com). To complement these, SWGfL will be offering EPICT e safety CPD certification opportunities for professionals across the nation. UK Helpline: SWGfL  As well as coordinating and contributing to the Awareness centre, SWGfL will also be piloting an entirely new online safety helpline for professionals.  The helpline will offer support, advice and mediation directly to where it is needed to become a real lifeline for any South West (UK) professionals and volunteers working with children. UK Hotline: The Internet Watch Foundation: IWF operates the UK Hotline for reporting and removing illegal online content specifically, child sexual abuse images hosted anywhere in the world and criminally obscene and incitement to racial hatred content hosted in the UK. IWF is an independent self-regulatory body, funded by the EU and the wider online sector, who work in partnership with industry, law enforcement, government, the education sector, charities, international partners and the public. As a result of this approach, illegal content within our remit has been virtually eradicated from UK networks. IWF strives to create continued awareness of the role and purpose of the IWF and aim to foster trust and reassurance in the internet for current and future users. IWF is a member of INHOPE. www.iwf.org.uk    **** Contact information **** WRIGHT David Belvedere House, Woodwater Park, Pynes Hill EX2 5WS Exeter United Kingdom Tel. 07899 905387 Fax. 01392 366494";"Safer Internet 2009-2013 Programme";" 1.1 + 2.1 + 2.3 - Safer Internet centre with hotline and helpline";" Euro 2.02m";" Euro 1.50m";" SI-2009-ACHL-123926";" From 01/10/2010 to 30/06/2012";" Closed";" Safer Internet 2009-2013 Programme IN Integrated Network ";"3";"1"

With support from EU Safer Internet programs the former projects have been highly successful in gaining attention and reference among the teachers, pupils, media, politicians, industry and NGOs in Norway. In 2009 the Safer Internet NO AN project launched a nationwide campaign with distribution of the e-safety kit to 120 000 Norwegian homes. Parents and children were the main target groups. In addition, the project has just started a large attention campaign (Use your head-campaign) together with the largest mobile phone company in Norway, Telenor. The purpose is to put cyberbullying on the agenda. The Safer Internet NO AC- project will act as the National Safer Internet Centre in Norway and collaborate with industry, governmental bodies and NGOs to reach a high level of awareness on safe use issues among children, parents, teacher and carers concerning interactive digital media like Internet, mobile phones and computer games. The Safer Internet NO AC- project will also collaborate with the National Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) in Norway to make it easier to report illegal material on Internet. NCIS is responsible for the Red button and Hotline in Norway. Together with the Norwegian Red Cross the new Safer Internet NO AC project will try out a new helpline service. **** Contact information **** HEPSOE Thomas Nygata 4 NO-1607 FREDRIKSTAD Norway Tel. +47 69 30 12 59 Fax. +47 69 30 12 01";"Safer Internet 2009-2013 Programme";" 1.1 SI CENTRE + 2.3 - Safer Internet centre with helpline";" Euro 0.57m";" Euro 0.35m";" SI-2009-ACHP-103902";" From 01/10/2010 to 31/03/2012";" Closed";" Safer Internet 2009-2013 Programme IN Integrated Network ";"2";"1"

The project builds upon the successful implementation of a national Safer Internet Hotline project running over the period July 2005 &ndash; January 2008 and Setting up combined SAFEr InterNET node in Bulgaria from June 2009 till May 2010. The Internet safety of children is a relatively new concept to Bulgaria and the general level of awareness is still quite low. The integration of hotline, awareness node and helpline into a single Safer Internet Centre will enhance the visibility and overall impact of all Internet safety actions implemented in Bulgaria. It will contribute to a stronger public perception of the various actions and initiatives, their closer coordination and more coherent nature. In this way the three components would mutually reinforce the efficiency of their efforts and the impact of their activities. The Bulgarian Safer Internet Centre will be operated by a consortium of three partners under the overall co-ordination of ARC Fund, which will continue its function as national Hotline operator and will additionally supervise the other two components activities.

"project-SI-2009-SIC-123908";"Safer Internet MT SIC: Be Smart Online! - A Safer Internet Centre for Malta";"**** The Safer Internet Centre in Malta integrates awareness raising, a hotline and a helpline. **** In Malta, diffusion of formal ICT education and internet access in primary and secondary schools has resulted in a very high proportion of children using the internet when compared to the EU27 average. Their parents, by contrast, fare relatively badly, and there is a generational digital divide which reduces the capacity to safeguard children from online abuse. Government&rsquo;s ICT policy proposes an alliance with all stakeholders involved in order to develop an innovative awareness initiative to protect children from harm and abuse over the Internet. The Be Smart Online! project will act on this concept to achieve its main objectives, namely to act as a Safer Internet Centre in Malta and to cooperate with other actions under the Safer Internet Programme. The awareness raising actions will include creative campaigns targeting children, youths, parents, educators and the general public with the aim of informing them of the dangers of internet illegal and harmful content. A national partnership will be established, including an Advisory Board and Youth Panel, as well as active participation in the European Safer Internet network. The project will include a hotline to fight illegal content and contributing to the European URL database. A helpline will also be set up to answer online questions and telephone calls from children and parents related to problems encountered during their use of online technologies. As a result of the project implementation, many children, parents and educators will be made aware of the dangers of the internet and other electronic media, and of the tools available to counteract these dangers, such as monitoring and filtering software. The high profile of the project will ensure good participation by the principal stakeholders, leading to significant multiplication of the impacts and longer term sustainability. The project will further result in trained helpline staff, and that the various events, campaigns and the project website will provide the hotline and helpline with continued visibility. The Be Smart Online! consortium will be coordinated by the Malta Communications Authority, and will include the Foundation for Social Welfare Services- Agenzija Appogg, the Directorate for Educational Services, and the Office of the Commissioner for Children. **** Contact information **** SPITERI Mark Valletta Waterfront, Pinto Wharf FRN1913 Floriana MT Tel.

Empowerment is the core of our activities: B-SIC will empower every target group to take up their responsibilities. To help them, B-SIC will develop specific tools to increase parents, teachers and young people&rsquo;s knowledge on how to stay safe and resilient on the internet. B-SIC strongly believes in educating our society&rsquo;s educators so they can educate children and young people. B-SIC rolls out this &lsquo;train-the-trainer&rsquo;- approach on two levels. We will train trainers who can train parents / teachers who can train children. B-SIC will establish a fully equipped helpline specialised in online safety. The helpline will be targeted to the main public in general and parents and children in particular. The helpline will take on all questions concerning the use and misuse of the internet and other information- and communication technologies. The communication campaign dedicated to seek visibility and the enhancement of public awareness, will focus on the three C-risks: harmful contact (grooming), harmful conduct (cyberbullying), harmful content for children. This helpline will be the first and only one in Belgium to target these questions. B-SIC will continue to be guided by an Advisory Board, representing experts from Law Enforcement Agencies, ISP, industry, government, universities, NGO&rsquo;s. Its regular meetings will facilitate dialogue between all stakeholders. B-SIC will continue to work with a Youth Forum to contribute to the design of awareness raising activities.

The project will be coordinated by Office for Internet Safety (OIS). Awareness Raising will be carried out by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE). It aims to educate and promote dialogue between children, teachers and parents on safe and appropriate use of the internet and new media. It will build on the experience and resources developed by the NCTE Webwise initiative to promote the responsible and effective use of the Internet among school children (ages 4 &ndash; 18), their parents and teachers. The Webwise internet safety initiative will build on tools and resources developed under previous projects. NCTE will promote Internet Safety through its Teaching Skills Initiative, through events and promotional activity and the webwise.ie and watchyourspace.ie websites. With the National Parents' Council it will deliver Internet Safety information nights for parents. The Children's Helpline will be operated by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC), providing a national freephone helpline where children can raise concerns about illegal and harmful content related to their use of online technologies. It will offer one-to-one conversation with trained helpers 24/7 and assist children to deal with any negative effects of encountering illegal or harmful content on the internet. The Adult Helpline will be operated by the National Parents' Council, and will be an extension of the NPC's existing national confidential helpline for parents, focusing on internet safety including issues relating to cyberbullying. The Hotline will be run by the Internet Service Provider&rsquo;s Association of Ireland Ltd. (ISPAI). It will provide a means for the public to report suspected illegal content or activities found on the Internet. It will assess the content and where found illegal will pass the report, with related technical information, to police or appropriate INHOPE hotlines for action. The expected impact is to achieve rapid notification for take-down of illegal content and to act as a deterrent to continue Ireland's near zero incidence of illegal content hosted in or distributed from this jurisdiction. **** Contact information **** LAFFAN John  DUBLIN IRELAND Tel.

It is the continuation and expansion of the existing project. The mission of SI Austria is threefold: 1. To run inventive, attention-grabbing and informative awareness campaigns about online safety. Target groups are minors, parents, teachers, youth workers and multipliers (media, public authorities, industry and NGOs). 2. To operate the Austrian hotline Stopline against child pornography on the Internet. Stopline&rsquo;s goal is to set a significant contribution to the removal of illegal content by assisting users and ISPs how to react on such content as well as by closely cooperating with law enforcement authorities. 3. To offer a cost-free telephone and online helpline where children and parents can obtain advice on how to deal with harmful contact, content and conduct related to using online technologies (in co-operation with the largest Austrian telephone helpline for minors 147 Rat auf Draht). Strengthening already established partnerships with all relevant Austrian key players (as organised in the Safer Internet Austria Advisory Board) is considered as the decisive foundation for SI Austria. The second important approach to reach target groups is extensive media work. The participation of minors ensures the appropriateness of awareness raising measures. Measures are adapted to European context in order to foster active European co-operation in the networks INHOPE and INSAFE and to support less experienced nodes. A highlight of the multitude of events organised by SI Austria is the annual European Safer Internet Day. OIAT is overall coordinator of SI Austria and technical coordinator of the awareness centre and helpline Saferinternet.at, nic.at is technical coordinator of the hotline Stopline and ISPA is consortium partner of Saferinternet.at. SI Austria has strong documented support from 32 stakeholders, including the Federal Chancellery, most relevant ministries, law enforcement agencies, youth and parental organisations and research institutions. The duration of the proposed project is 24 months. **** Contact information **** JUNGWIRTH Bernhard OESTERREICHISCHES INSTITUT FUER ANGEWANDTE TELEKOMMUNIKATION  AUSTRIA Tel.

"project-SIP-2005-ANH-038015";"SafeNetHomePlus: Awareness campaign to promote and encourage positive & critical thinking, educating how to protect ourselves and our privacy on the Internet and new online technologies, aiming at SafeNet-everywhere";"The objectives of SafeNetHomePlus are: to conduct a multi-channel awareness campaign to promote and inspire positive and critical thinking for safer use of the Internet and new online technologies; continue the SafeNetHome project efforts while addressing new threats and ways to prevent them; continue and broaden the international cooperation through the awareness network. The above objectives fully respect the principles of the Safer Internet plus programme: continuity and enhancement. The approach chosen for creating successful awareness in Greece is in line with the latest Eurobarometer survey, concerning the ways the Greeks wish to receive information about using the Internet in a safer way: a) to create awareness through TV, the radio and the press, supported by the Greek SaferInternet portal and a set of awareness tools; b) to educate parents, children but also reporters and the general public through special social and educational activities, and to create a multiplier-effect network, by mobilising the teachers to become awareness raisers in their classrooms and among their peers, and the reporters to spread our messages through the mass media channels. Besides its awareness work, SafeNetHomePlus will further expand the helpline â801 11 EKATOâ, which has been operating since 2001 for consumer problems, and since 2002 for any kind of matters around interactive technologies problems.

Children, young people and their families tend to be in the vanguard of new media adoption, benefiting from early take-up of new opportunities afforded by the Internet, mobile and broadband content, online games, peer-to-peer technologies, and so forth. However, they also encounter a range of risky or negative experiences for which they may be unprepared.  To guide the development of a flexible policy framework, a rigorous, updated, context-sensitive research base is vital. EU Kids Online is a three-year study of research across a diverse range of European countries. Researchers from European countries collaborate, in order to identify, compare and evaluate the available body of evidence. They bring expertise from different disciplines, specialisms and methods in order to ask some important but hitherto unanswered questions:  What research exists, is ongoing or, crucially, is still needed?  What risks exist, for which technologies, and in relation to which (sub)populations?  How do social, cultural and regulatory influences affect the incidence and experience of, and the responses to different risks?  Further, in accounting for current and ongoing research, and anticipating future research, what factors shape the research capability of European research institutions and networks? **** Contact information **** LIVINGSTONE Sonia Houghton Street WC2A 2AE LONDON UK Tel. +44 (0) 20 7955 7710 Fax. +44 (0) 20 7955 7248";"Safer Internet Plus Programme";" 4.4 MEDIA - Awareness-raising";" Euro 0.50m";" Euro 0.50m";" SIP-2005-MD-038229";" From 26/06/2006 to 25/06/2009";" Closed";" Safer Internet Plus Programme TN Thematic Network ";"1";"1"

The awareness node will educate and inform people how to protect themselves from the dangers of the Internet, as a preventive and awareness action, and the hotline will be a resource for citizens to report illegal or harmful contents. In more detail: 1. Awareness node As an awareness node, the projects and actions developed under the objective to inform and educate citizens, not only in what concerns to the type and nature of dangers underlying the use of the Internet, but also to provide the means and instruments available to prevent those same dangers. The PSI project is ambitious in these objectives as it will try to implement actions and communication strategies in order to achieve as diverse target groups as possible. 2. Hotline At a European and International level, the hotline service will build upon the experience of other hotlines, either by communicating to police force illegal content hosted in Portugal, or to inform other hotlines of illegal and harmful content hosted abroad. It will essentially be another resource of INHOPE to achieve their objectives. With the project conclusion, Portugal will have a fully operational system that will try to achieve four main objectives:    1. Citizens to report illegal or harmful content (identifying themselves or       in anonymity);    2. An analytical team to study and produce denouncing reports;    3. A light communication process to report legally the content to police       forces;    4. A commitment with Internet Service Providers to block content until       judicial analysis is made and to adapt, if necessary, their common       acceptable usage condition objectives. **** Contact information **** BARBOSA FRAGOSO Bruno Alexandre Taguspark, Edificio InovaÃ§ao I,2Â°, sala 124 Porto Salvo PORTUGAL Tel.

The fact that many harmful contents are given innocent names (fakes) makes the risk of facing such content a key issue, and the growth of the number of (young) users makes the situation even more alarming. However, no solution to this issue has been proposed yet. The core objective of this project is to change this by providing an accurate content rating and fake detection system usable for user empowerment and filtering in P2P systems.     * It will evaluate the probability for a given file to have paedophile or       pornographic content, and/or to be a fake. Its access will be freely       provided to end-users and appropriate institutions (law enforcement       authorities, hotlines, awareness nodes, child protection institutions,       etc).     * In addition, we will construct a dynamic list of paedophile keywords,       useful for law enforcement and filtering, and provide it freely to the       relevant institutions on a monthly basis. These two tasks rely on large-scale measurements of P2P activity, which will be performed during this project for these needs. These data will also make it possible to increase significantly our knowledge of P2P paedophile activity. We will perform detailed analysis on this basis, in order to produce leading reference reports on the topic. Databases concerning paedophile exchanges obtained by our measurements will also be provided to relevant institutions, to encourage further studies. This will improve awareness on P2P safety issues and help decision making in law enforcement and promotion of a safer internet. The consortium puts together well established, recognised institutions having leading and complementary skills in the fields needed to achieve the objectives: P2P activity measurement, management and analysis of the obtained data with a particular focus on paedophile activity and information dissemination on these topics. **** Contact information **** LATAPY Matthieu Avenue du PrÃ©sident Kennedy 104 75016 PARIS FR Tel. +33 1 44 27 87 84 Fax. +33 1 44 27 74 95";"Safer Internet Plus Programme";" 2.2 PILOT PROJECT - Tackling unwanted and harmful content";" Euro 0.91m";" Euro 0.45m";" SIP-2006-PP-221003";" From 01/10/2007 to 30/09/2009";" Closed";" Safer Internet Plus Programme TP ";"4";"4"

The original 2-year QUATRO project identified a demand for and the usefulness of interoperable, machine-readable quality labels; created a platform for their delivery and authentication; and developed two end-user tools. QUATRO Plus seeks to build on the work done and to extend its scope significantly, notably by allowing users to contribute to both the creation of labels and the trust that other users may put in them. In this context, the project seeks to increase greatly the number of labelling authorities using the system and to promote a labelling culture.  The objectives of QUATRO Plus are to:     * Prove the benefits and potential of authenticated machine-readable labels       to a variety of commercial interests across Europe, including trustmark       operators, awards bodies, users, portals, search engines and software       manufacturers.     * Allow end users to record and share their agreement or disagreement with       a label&rsquo;s description and to create their own labels to share       directly with their friends.     * Aggregate all available user-generated labels and opinions expressed       about existing labels, without attribution,  into an open source of data.     * Provide simple to use tools for label creation.     * Provide a flexible and scalable infrastructure. The work programme consists of 10 work packages; the first 3 address the project management, assessment and dissemination activities and include usability testing of software. The subsequent work packages focus upon engaging new Labelling Authorities to participate in QUATRO, making improvements to the existing infrastructure and the addition of core interactive features such as user-authentication, receipt, storage and sharing of labels. A major work package is the application of quality labels to social networking. In addition, the project seeks to encourage and facilitate publication of expert opinion as quality labels, support for user preferences within QUATRO (personalisation) and to enable institutions to use QUATRO Plus within their intranets. The QUATRO Plus consortium is a proven mix of management, dissemination and technical skills required to deliver and enhance the existing quality label infrastructure and tools which will enable European and global take-up. **** Contact information **** BASSETT Sheena Fitzgerald Road 2B SW14 8HA London United Kingdom Tel. +44 1306 631780 Fax.";"Safer Internet Plus Programme";" 2.1 USER EMPOWERMENT - Tackling unwanted and harmful content";" Euro 0.87m";" Euro 0.44m";" SIP-2006-UE-211001";" From 01/10/2007 to 30/09/2009";" Closed";" Safer Internet Plus Programme TP ";"10";"6"

Through these efforts the network will be able to reduce duplication within agencies and increase cross border liaison. This will result in Law Enforcement freeing up recourses, traditionally used on web related cases, for other child sexual abuse investigations.This will further result in more efficient and targeted policing in the area of child exploitation, including investigations directed at financial institutions and organised criminal groups. Circamp will seek to: 1. Introduce a filtering system, the CSAADF (Child Sexual Abuse Anti Distribution Filter), in all participating countries which will block the numerous child abuse image sites that are available on the Internet. This would then limit the availability of child sexual abusive material on the Internet and reduce the potential customer base for commercial distribution, thus making the commercial distribution of such material less profitable. In addition there will be a substantial harm reduction effect, limiting the accidental and unwilling exposure to child abuse material for the general population and making the Internet much safer for all users. 2. Cooperate with financial institutions operating on and off the Internet, being unwillingly used for criminal purposes related to child sexual exploitation and the distribution of depicted child sexual abuse. 3. Disrupt the organized criminal groups and/or structures involved in the commercial distribution of child sexual abusive material.

These developments have had a similar impact on the production and distribution of child abuse. Analogue material has been mostly replaced by digital material. Illegal material is distributed efficiently and commercially via the internet. While photos are still found in huge amounts, police forces have seen a very steep increase of videos containing child abuse in the last 5 years. In the video domain, police forces worldwide are struggling because of lack of tools to handle the huge amounts of video data efficiently. I-DASH is targeted to the needs of police forces to process video material (potentially) containing child sexual abuse and coordinate investigations at a European level. The project will be carried out by the developmentteam: University of Amsterdam, TNO, IST, University of Surrey and ZiuZ. These partners have many years of combined experience in video analysis, European collaboration and system development for child abuse and other police investigations. In a project like I-Dash involvement of end users is essential for success. End users are by far the best group for creating awareness among other potential end users.

With support from EU Safer Internet plus programme the former projects (NONO/NONOplus) have been highly successful in gaining attention and reference among the teachers, pupils, media, politicians, industry and NGOs in Norway. The NONOsafe project will act as the national awareness network node in Norway and collaborate with industry, governmental bodies and NGOs to reach a high level of awareness on safe use issues among children, parents, teacher and carers concerning interactive digital medias like Internet, mobile phones and computer games. The awareness-raising in the new NONOsafe project will be based on facts from the new Safe Use survey conducted in January 2008 that shows that the main challenge for young people in Norway today is their unauthorized distribution of pictures and videos of peers via Internet and mobile phones. More than 1 out of 5 among the age group 8 to 18 years has experienced this problem. This problem has to be addressed through different means spanning from online material and quizzes, brochures and media attention to text books used at primary schools. In addition the applicant organisation Norwegian Media Authority will use its youth panel even more active in the new NONOsafe project to let the children express their own experiences and concerns regarding online technologies. The NONOsafe project will also collaborate with the National Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) in Norway to make it easier to report illegal material on Internet. The NONOsafe project will extend its collaboration with the European network of awareness nodes and try to conduct more European wide activities in addition to Safer Internet Day. Some of these activities can be similar to the collaboration between Denmark, Norway and Sweden in participating at the same day talking to children about online safety issues in the social MMO-game Habbo Hotel. **** Contact information **** LIESTOL Eva Nygata 4 1607 Fredrikstad Norway Tel. 47 69301200 Fax. 47 69301201";"Safer Internet Plus Programme";"";" Euro 0.53m";" Euro 0.40m";" SIP-2008-AN-411802";" From 01/10/2008 to 30/09/2010";" Closed";" Safer Internet Plus Programme IN Integrated Network ";"1";"1"

The campaign which is called Samfélag, fjölskylda og tækni, acronym SAFT (community, family and technology), will use the most appropriate media, taking into account best practices of previous awareness work nationally and experiences in other countries. An already established partnership with key national stakeholders (i.e. educators, government agencies, press/media, consumers, parent associations and the industry) will provide guidelines and support for developing educational materials and awareness campaigns. SAFT will also co-operate with other national nodes by exchanging information about best practices, participating in meetings and designing and implementing a European wide approach in reaching the target groups, adapted as necessary for national linguistic and cultural preferences.  The awareness focus will be on net-ethics, social network sites, source criticism, mobile phone-, internet-, and computer/online game-use with education models (including peer-to-peer modules), media campaigns, brochures and posters. A story book will be produced and delivered to all kindergartens and primary and secondary classes of elementary schools in Iceland. Teaching material will be sent to all elementary schools in Iceland in collaboration with life-skill and information technology teachers. Special focus will be on establishing a clear and active role for the Youth Panel. The panel will meet regularly and play an active role in producing and implementing teaching modules and campaigns. &ldquo;Train the Trainer&rdquo; meetings will be held across Iceland with teachers as the main target group. At least two national campaigns are planned, one concerning internet filtering and the other concerning net ethics, social networking sites and grooming.

The PSIplus project is ambitious in these objectives as it will continue to implement actions and communication strategies in order to achieve as diverse target groups as possible. 2. Hotline At a European and International level, the hotline service will continue to build its know how upon the experience of other hotlines, either by communicating to police force illegal content hosted in Portugal, or to inform other hotlines of illegal and harmful content hosted abroad. It will essentially continue to be another resource of Inhope to achieve their objectives. With the project conclusion, Portugal will have a fully operational system that will try to achieve four main objectives: 1) Citizens to report illegal or harmful content (identifying themselves or in anonymity); 2) An analytical team to study and produce denouncing reports; 3) A light communication process to report legally the content to police forces; 4) A commitment with Internet Service Providers to block content until judicial analysis is made and to adapt, if necessary, their common acceptable usage condition objectives. **** Contact information **** FRAGOSO Bruno Taguspark - Edificio InovaÃ§ao I, Sala 124 - 2Â° 2740-122 Porto Salva PORTUGAL Tel.

Researchers will conduct a scoping study that will review online groomers case files, provide a report of the research and policy literature from each partner country, and interview strategic stakeholders concerned with the management and prevention of online grooming.  The main phase of the research will involve in-depth interviews with online groomers in the UK, Italy, Belgium and Norway. The final phase of the research encompasses dissemination events to policy makers, professionals, teachers, parents and young people. 6 partners from 4 different European countries are working together on this project. **** Contact information **** WEBSTER Stephen Northampton Square 35 EC1V 0AX LONDON UK Tel. +44(0)20 7549 8550 Fax. +44(0)20 7250 1524";"Safer Internet Plus Programme";"";" Euro 0.42m";" Euro 0.42m";" SIP-2008-KEP-311804";" From 01/06/2009 to 30/11/2011";" Closed";" Safer Internet Plus Programme KEP Knowledge Enhancement Project ";"6";"4"

The project is operationalised according to four methodological principles:  (i) a critical approach is required to examine, test and qualify taken-for- granted assumptions regarding the nature, extent and interpretation of online risk, the nature and degree of children&rsquo;s internet literacy and the effectiveness of parental regulation;  (ii) a contextual approach is required to identify the social, cultural or individual factors that account for differential experiences of, and responses to, risk;  (iii) a child-centred approach is required to recognise and inform the gap in perspectives and practices between adults and children;  (iv) a comparative approach is required to identify and analyse similarities and differences in children&rsquo;s online risk experiences across Europe. **** Contact information **** LIVINGSTONE Sonia Houghton Street WC2A 2AE LONDON UK Tel. +44 (0) 20 7955 7710 Fax. +44 (0) 20 7955 7248";"Safer Internet Plus Programme";"";" Euro 2.50m";" Euro 2.50m";" SIP-2008-KEP-321803";" From 01/07/2009 to 30/06/2011";" Closed";" Safer Internet Plus Programme KEP Knowledge Enhancement Project ";"5";"5"
"project-SIP-2008-TP-131801";"FIVES: Forensic Image and Video Examination Support";"**** The FIVES project will develop a self-contained tool set that is easy to use and focus on speed and efficient execution to help the police investigators analysing large amounts of data. **** Police investigations of child sexual abuse cases often face the problem of handling large amounts of seized equipment. To look for illegal images and videos or other investigative leads in the large amounts of data found on seized storage devices is typically a slow and tedious work. An average investigation could have several terabytes of data stored in different media and formats. The objective of the FIVES project is to develop novel investigative tools specifically tailored for investigations involving images and videos of child sexual abuse. The FIVES tool set will allow police and law-enforcement agencies to:     * speed up the process of handling very large amounts of evidence material       on seized computers, and separate previously known illegal material from       new, potentially illegal, material by efficient file and file fragment       matching.     * efficiently evaluate large amounts of new material by employing       perceptual optimization techniques. This aims to minimize the human       effort needed when classifying new material.     * improve the capability of linking new illegal images and video to       previously known material by using object matching and image similarity       techniques to allow details of crime scenes to be linked between       different image sets or videos. This facilitates the widening of       investigations with the aim of rescuing the victims of sexual abuse. The tools will be based on already existing research and software created by the academic partners that will be adapted, extended and integrated into an easy to use tool set that fits the police requirements. The project's technical work packages will create a forensic engine that provides base functionality, and a number of modules. One module will provide new file fragment matching functionality, and others will provides specialized image and video handling functionality to support police work. There are also work packages for performing a user requirements study and end-user field tests as well as for ensuring sustainability of project results after the end of the project. The expected end result of the FIVES project is a self-contained tool set distribution that is easy to use and that supports easy translation to languages across Europe. The FIVES tool set will have an impact both on front- end investigations and on more specialized investigations by providing easy to use, new and powerful investigative functionality, with a focus on speed and efficient execution. **** Contact information **** GARCIA Johan Universitetgatan 2 65188 Karlstad SE Tel. +46 54 7001789 Fax. +46 54 7001828";"Safer Internet Plus Programme";"";" Euro 0.80m";" Euro 0.55m";" SIP-2008-TP-131801";" From 01/02/2009 to 31/01/2011";" Closed";" Safer Internet Plus Programme TP Targeted Project ";"6";"5"
